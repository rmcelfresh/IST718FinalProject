# IST718FinalProject

This is the code and supporting datasets for a group final project for Syracuse University's MS in Appied Data Science Program. 
The course was: IST 718 Big Data Analytics

The goal of this project was to identify if there was any correlation between budget, cinematic world, and date of release with movies' box office results. The result of the analysis was not idea--mostly as a result of the small number of films in the analysis.
