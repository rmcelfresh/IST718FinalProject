AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,0,"Fans of the franchise will be pleased, but those looking in from the outside of comic-book culture may find themselves also looking at their watches."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,1,"""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" is a sometimes daffy, occasionally baffling, surprisingly touching and even romantic adventure with one kinetic thrill after another. It earns a place of high ranking in the Marvel Universe."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,2,"More does not necessarily equal better; here, more is just ... meh."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,3,"The sharp, interpersonal dramedy that made the first movie such a delight is again present in flashes, but not infrequently it is drowned out by the noisy, inevitable need to Save the World."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,4,"For the most part, ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" is the hard-charging, mind-boggling spectacle fans are looking for. Smash indeed."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,5,"World-saving is no longer a surprise to these characters. It's work. Grunt work. For them. For us."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,6,"Age of Ultron has gloomier veins and deeper belly laughs, but The Avengers was an event."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,7,"Avengers: Age of Ultron is the penultimate film of Marvel's Phase 2 and paves the landscape for phase 3 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,8,"With its vast cast, ever-accelerating action and cameos from the wider Marvel world, it has to keep doubling down on spectacle as it races to its epic conclusion."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,9,"In reality, it's nothing more than the action-packed culmination of three years-worth of superhero solo movies, and that's fine by me."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,10,I still enjoy Age of Ultron but not as much as I did when I first saw it.
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,11,"For every moment of disconnect and excess, there's a humanizing moment, a hilarious exchange, or a team up crowd pleaser"
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,12,It is once more a delicate juggling act which Whedon performs with aplomb.
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,13,"The Avengers don't seem cohesive, and we have weird attempts at character development."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,14,"There is a lot to like, but ultimately a lot to digest -- making its grand scale both a blessing and a curse."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,15,"[W]hatever its flaws, Age of Ultron is better than a roller coaster, and gives MCU fans plenty to chew on."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,16,"The movie embodies what we want in a Marvel film - it's smart, cool, full of vivid stunts and effects with well-delineated characters played by top actors."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,17,"AGE OF ULTRON isn't going to exceed the expectations of the first Avengers' film, but, it will be one a helluva carnival ride."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,18,"I respect Whedon for not attempting a retread, but not all of his risks pay off."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,19,"The return of the Avengers crew, though bringing little new to the table after the 2012 series opener, Avengers Assemble, is an amiable enough hokum diversion for 2+ hours."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,20,"it didn't blow me away like the first one, but that's probably understandable given that there wasn't the same ""Holy crap, it's an actual Avengers movie! I haven't wasted my life!"" factor at play."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,21,"If the Marvel Cinematic Universe is a collectible card game, Avengers: Age Of Ultron is the best booster pack you could possibly get"
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,22,"As good as ""Age of Ultron"" is, it just leaves something to be desired. Still, you'll get the action you crave, you'll get some witty one-liners, and you'll have a really good time."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,23,"Age of Ultron feels defined by studio interference, making me happy that Joss Whedon is no longer involved with Marvel - a talented writer/director of his stature shouldn't be compromising his vision for anybody."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,24,"You may learn something before it's all done and it makes a billion dollars."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,25,Age of Ultron knew to keep a good thing going and I am happy to report that this film is honestly really funny too.
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,26,"By far the worst movie in the MCU. Also, Why must Ultron have lips?"
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,27,"Age of Ultron goes big - big cast, worldwide destruction, giant robot army - but in the end, it feels like very little happened."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,28,"the film is highly entertaining, and I don't want to acid rain on anyone's parade. If you like Mavel's Avengers, you'll love Age of Ultron. It's an extra large helping of more of the same, with a radioactive cherry on top."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,29,"For the most part, it's a high energy action film, delivering what Marvel fans expect."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,30,"The biggest hurdle for movies that reach the levels of success that The Avengers did is repeating something close to it in a sequel. Age of Ultron may have missed the mark, but it wasn't by much."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,31,"[""Age of Ultron""] had some pretty big, overshadowing boots to fill, but ultimately, the movie certainly has the right stuff - flaws and all - to win the day."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,32,"(Whedon is) less a thinker than a teaser, throwing out an inexhaustible amount of ticklish ideas and tasty images that thrill from moment to moment then disappear from memory."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,33,There so many plots in this movie and so many scene that are JUST there to set up future movies...It moves too fast.
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,34,"...it works on its own terms, proving Whedon's skill at managing an epic story full of different heroes and villains. [Full review in Spanish]"
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,35,"Hawkeye makes a self-aware remark that none of this makes any sense, and you know what, he's right. There's also nothing to be ashamed of; at the end of the day it's grand fun"
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,36,"Entertaining, funny and full of action. Another cinematic team-up hit. [Full review in Spanish]"
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,37,"Hardcore fans will find enough to enjoy here, but I found the pace at times slow, the visual effects somewhat disappointing (particularly compared to The Winter Soldier) and the story less than engrossing."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,38,"The chemistry between the Avengers grounds it. At heart, it's a story about friends and friendship. A completely bananas story about friends and friendship, featuring a murderous robot."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,39,"Age Of Ultron will make fans jump for joy, especially when it comes to tying up the loose ends of Thanos and the Infinity Gauntlet that the earlier Marvel movies had teased about."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,40,"With delectable James Spader voicing Ultron, a robotic artificial intelligence programme, and an opening sequence with The Avengers battling a terrorist group in a frozen wood, Whedon has more than delivered on his promise."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,41,"At 141 minutes, the sequel is almost even in length with the original, so why does it feel so much longer?"
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,42,"This blockbuster sequel has a plot more convoluted than the Biblical begats. Knowing that the New Yorker critic Anthony Lane was stumped as well makes me feel slightly better. But it didn't make the movie-going experience any more enjoyable."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,43,"That Joss Whedon is able to address the changing beliefs and needs of each of the characters in Age of Ultron is impressive to say the least. That he does so in a way that feels believable is, well, pretty marvelous."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,44,"Whedon affectionately says goodbye while cementing the future of a franchise that, though it seems impossible, will represent future far-reaching narrative complexities. [Full review in Spanish]"
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,45,"There is little in this film that is new, but that doesn't matter. The characters are still entertaining, the action scenes thrilling and near orgasmic, and the human relationships touching."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,46,"It really, really feels like the 11th exhausting film in the unstoppable ring cycle of movies based on the Avengers comic-book heroes -- a vast and increasingly dull series of blockbusters planned out, terrifyingly, as far ahead as 2019."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,47,"Convoluted, messy, and over-stuffed, The Avengers: Age of Ultron also somehow manages to be an incredibly enjoyable ride. Each of the actors bring their A-game, and each of their characters has their own moment to shine."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,48,"While we do get plenty of funny or touching interactions between the main characters, the film feels poorly structured and overly reliant on gigantic action sequences."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,49,"It's too bad Avengers: Age of Ultron lacks dramatic tension and has a more or less nonsensical plotline, because its component parts are frequently entertaining."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,50,"It's as entertaining as holiday fireworks: initially exciting, which fades; then just loud, and finally the sense of time wasted because everything you just watched was pretty, but utterly meaningless."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,51,"Whedon has already announced that he won't be on board for the next installment, and you can hardly blame him. These films don't require a director. All they need are bean counters."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,52,"Several thrilling action sequences, a great many good jokes, and an unshakable sense that everybody is just going through the paces."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,53,"This Avengers is darker, louder, stranger and soapier than the first one."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,54,"As a deliberate extension of multiple brands all at once, as the latest lily pad to Marvel's next big thing, it's a solid success, if not much in the way of an evolution."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,55,Exciting but a slightly inferior sequel.
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,56,"It's exactly what it intends to be: popcorn entertainment."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,57,"It's to his great credit that the film feels like a Joss Whedon film. In other words, it has a character of its own, and after 11 films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, that's something to enjoy and appreciate."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,58,Age of Ultron is almost exactly the movie you expect.
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,59,"Avengers: Age of Ultron may drag and creak during its 2 1/2 hours. But it's still often thrilling, briefly moving cinema."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,60,"It's not just bad, it's disappointing. [Full review in Spanish]"
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,61,"I can't think of a movie with a higher action to non-action ratio. Or maybe I just don't want to."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,62,"Loud, fluffy, and rather unsatisfying."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,63,"Technically, the film is excellent, with seamless CGI, and top-notch performances throughout, though moments are dark (literally, squinting-to-see dark)."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,64,"Keeping a monster of a blockbuster on the rails, Whedon delivers an epic slice of superhero cinema."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,65,"If you don't already love costumed adventurers, this outing won't give you any fresh incentive, but fans will learn more about their heroes."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,66,"Whedon's strategy is to keep the action constant, the banter clever, and to switch between characters before we have time to think about anything too deeply. When it comes to engineering plot, he's a genius who could give Stark a run for his money."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,67,"In short, this is a hugely entertaining, superbly made blockbuster that delivers everything you could want in terms of action, humour, character and emotion and won't disappoint fans of the first film. Highly recommended."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,68,"Age of Ultron's first act is basically one long doozy of a set piece, which manages to give us time alone with every principle character and give them some connective tissue in battle together, too."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,69,"Everything a popcorn movie should be, with a little Renaissance grandeur on the side."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,70,"Director Joss Whedon takes a big stick to the over-stuffed piata of Marvel Comics' characters and successfully empties out all the candy, but leaves a landscape strewn with plastic wrappers and the promise of a pounding headache"
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,71,A remarkable and often fantastic follow up...
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,72,"Avengers: Age of Ultron may follow the structure and beats of its predecessor pretty closely, but it still manages to pack a punch that's just as exciting."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,73,"Is Avengers: Age Of Ultron the point where the Marvel Cinematic Universe goes too far? Hel no! But ... it's hard not to feel it somewhat missed the mark."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,74,"Whedon delivers enough fun, action, and engaging team banter that fans will exit pleased but perhaps not giddy with joy."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,75,pointless
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,76,"Whedon returns to assemble his team once more in Avengers: Age Of Ultron, and the results are at the same time familiar, different and as thrilling as ever before."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,77,"It scarcely needs to be said that there's a certain lack of freshness here, and some plot developments from the original graphic novels that we really didn't need - although, of course, there's also some seriously cool Avenger-ing too."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,78,"Writer/director Joss Whedon balances comedy and derring-do with dexterity, and this sequel to 2012's top grosser doesn't stall the franchise."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,79,"Incredibly expensive action scenes full of destruction go on for way too long with little context behind them, leading to overkill and boredom."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,80,"This time, it has become darker for the fanboys and a little more interesting for the rest of us."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,81,This is a film that unfolds with every re-watch and reveals more subtle little grace notes.
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,82,"This sequel also represents Whedon's last go-around with the Marvel heroes, and while it succeeds in many ways, it's enough of a comedown to suggest that he's getting off the carousel at the right time."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,83,"Like the first film, what makes the sequel work is how director Joss Whedon builds the action on this character foundation and injects it with just enough humor to make its personality radiate."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,84,"It's possible to approve of how such a billion-dollar apparatus can be this fast and breezy."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,85,"That isn't to say I didn't enjoy myself. I just didn't feel Marvel trying to do anything different this time around."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,86,"There's something to be had here, with such fine actors and seamless interlacing into a mega fantasy world, but overall the embarrassment of riches doesn't quite pay dividends."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,87,"Avengers: Age of Ultron firmly confirms its place as the nadir of the Marvel cinematic universe - which is no small feat, certainly, given that the studio's output has been almost uniformly terrible."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,88,Avengers: Age of Ultron is a pure popcorn-powered blast to begin the blockbuster season but nothing deeper this time.
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,89,"Director Joss Whedon's strengths - and better writing - really come through in the quieter moments. Relish those while you can."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,90,"Stan Lee says, ""Excelsior."" If that doesn't get you bouncing off the walls, you've clearly come to the wrong franchise."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,91,"Like Greek gods before them, superheroes are our modern myths, so why shouldn't they examine issues of the classic texts in our time? The end credit sequence actually gives this idea a visual corollary, as it shows a giant Hellenistic statue."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,92,"It's not so much what they do, it's what the Avengers say that makes ""Avengers: The Age of Ultron"" worth seeing on the big screen."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,93,"The movie is stiff and enervated. It's all punch-punch, banter-banter, like a sitcom in which cities get leveled."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,94,"The previous film is arguably the best superhero film ever so there was nowhere for a sequel to go but down...Surely audiences know this, yet expectations were other-worldy."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,95,"Whedon is pretty much locked into an overarching storyline and a bland house style here, so instead of bucking the system, he dutifully serves up more of the same bubble-brained gibberish and wanton destruction."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,96,"... The fact that ""Age of Ultron"" succeeds at all, even if not to the extent of ""The Avengers,"" is a major achievement."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,97,"The latest ""Avengers"" movie plays its music loud from start to finish. Mindless action rules, punctuated only by super hero/villain quips."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,98,"Isn't Tony Stark/Iron Man, stumping for 'a suit of armor around the world,' basically a combination Klaatu/Gort, endorsing the plan for an Earth-patrolling fascist robot army proposed by the alien visitor in 'The Day the Earth Stood Still'?"
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,99,"It has color, great delivery, amusing interludes, a cohesive story, and a payoff that doesn't betray the sensibilities of its direction."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,100,"Whedon's dense script runs the risk of feeling bloated, but his deft handling of characters and pacing ensure that everybody is where they need to be, and the audience is always right there with them."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,101,Saving the world can be a deadly serious and even grimly dour business. Thank goodness then for writer-director Joss Whedon.
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,102,"For the semi-initiated viewer, it's like experiencing a hurricane of story beats and Spandex."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,103,"an improvement over the first Avengers; everything feels smoother, the pacing is a bit better, and the overall plot is more intriguing"
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,104,"On par with its predecessor, Joss Whedon proves that he's more then capable of handling this franchise's biggest film, even if he's far from perfect at it."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,105,That sound you hear is the bubble getting near to bursting.
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,106,"The Avengers, we're told, are greater than the sum of their parts. Avengers: Age of Ultron is not. But it still boasts some pretty incredible parts. And one heck of a party."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,107,"Age of Ultron is a minute shorter than its predecessor, but it's a bigger movie in nearly every other regard."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,108,"It's difficult to sit through Age Of Ultron without feeling like a child. It's fun, touching, exciting, funny, enthralling, moving and spectacular, and it makes the fact that it could be Whedon's last MCU adventure even more upsetting."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,109,"... a comic book movie frequently begging to actually be a comic book, with panels allowing readers to pause and pour over fantastic detail that Whedon whizzes by... battle-rattling our senses from start to anticlimactic finish."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,110,"Feels like a bunch of those scenes Marvel usually reserves for the credits. It's more concerned about future films than the one it is actually in."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,111,"Joss Whedon set a higher bar with the first ""Avengers"" (2012) and tried, in many ways, to top it here. He got close..."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,112,"Avengers: Age of Ultron is the sequel of a profitable Marvel franchise, but it's far less interesting and powerful than the first instalment."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,113,"It's too big. It's too frenzied. It's too full of characters it can't contain. Mostly, it's just too much everything."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,114,"A thoroughly competent movie, sure; but its competence is so routine and mechanical as to leave the thing overwhelmingly dull."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,115,It misses the bar of classic movie greatness but Avengers: Age of Ultron is one of the most exciting and entertaining Marvel entries.
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,116,"Whedon's sincere love of this stuff is in most every shot, and that affection is infectious."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,117,"We've seen this stuff before but Whedon does bring a creative touch."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,118,"Like most sequels, this one isn't as good as the original. There's plenty of action and loud noises, but many of the characters seemed weaker and not as well-defined or as vividly portrayed as they were in the first film."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,119,"... tops the original ... yet, somehow it felt like less ... it may be time to take a cue from Captain America II to keep the stock plot outline from showing through ..."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,120,...mostly registers as yet another Marvel punchplosion.
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,121,A true ensemble piece of entertainment.
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,122,"('Age of Ultron') is, to paraphrase an old saying, 10 pounds of movie in a five-pound bag."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,123,"Fully embrace this Avengers sequel in all its Marvel-ousness! Despite some minor flaws, Age of Ultron packs an expected and welcomed thrill-ride punch."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,124,"We have seen the future of the CG-saturated action epic and ‒ upon emerging bruised and battered from the local megaplex ‒ can say with certitude that it isn't pretty."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,125,"The marvel that was 2012's The Avengers receives a letdown of a sequel ... Make no mistake: This new picture is worth seeing, but the sense of magic is largely missing from a follow-up that subscribes to the Bigger Is Better theory."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,126,Mr. Whedon seems to rely heavily on forced jocularity in lieu of substantial character development.
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,127,Avengers: Age of Ultron is the most substantial and significant Marvel film to date that is equally entertaining and electrifying.
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,128,"Better than the average sequel, yet less sharp, fresh and energetic than I'd hoped, there's still plenty to enjoy about Avengers: Age of Ultron that makes it well worth the tons of dosh it's sure to pull in."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,129,Like peering into the Dead Marshes for 142 minutes in IMAX 3D. All PG-13 robot carnage and no heart.
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,130,Joss Whedon seems the best-equipped to manage the sprawling franchise that demands a bigger cast and badder villain each time out.
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,131,"On the surface, all the elements are there for a summer blockbuster, but... comparing this film to The Avengers, there is no competition."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,132,"The cast, OMG. There are more people crowded in here - either in major roles or in brilliant cameos (Andy Serkis, I'm looking at you) - than are at Walgreens' on prom night."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,133,"At 141 minutes, it's a miracle the movie is never merely mechanical, but like JARVIS or Ultron, it's not fully human, either."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,134,"Formula flick. Period. High tech, high voltage action followed by long stretches of boring dialogue before more high tech, high voltage action. It's too long by 20-minutes."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,135,"Sufficiently fun to be worth a look for superhero fans, although it's kept from greatness by the very nature of the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,136,"Hitting society's central nervous system through the real fear of AI gone horribly rogue, this complete sequel package weaves together a rich story, rousing special effects and the sacrificial duality of being a superhero versus the layman."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,137,"Where the film falters is the action sequences, which are exciting and boost the adrenaline, but they have a repetitious, been-there-seen-that vibe."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,138,A sequel as epic as it is overly ambitious and as sprawling as it is restless.
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,139,"At risk of sounding too hyperbolic too soon, Avengers: Age of Ultron might be the best movie Marvel has ever made."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,140,"The cast is top-notch, and Whedon packs the script and the screen with cleverness as well as ka-pow. But even at 141 minutes, things still feel jammed and crammed."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,141,"For all its faults (and yes, there are plenty of them), this Avengers sequel is still a lot of fun."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,142,"The mayhem is clever but, functionally, Whedon is serving Disney's branding schemes first and his story and characters second."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,143,"Age of Ultron is part of a franchise that's going to make a billion dollars by Monday. But it still feels like one of Whedon's little sandboxes, blown up to a massive scale without losing any of its intricate resolution."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,144,"Overall, though, for all of its cheesy fun mixed with doom-and-gloom observations on the plight of humanity, this Avengers leaves us with the nagging feeling that we've been here too many times before."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,145,"The impressive thing about Marvel's Avengers: Age of Ultron is how writer/director Joss Whedon takes a narrative that is absolutely packed with superheroes and their backstories and all the action in between, and never lets it all feel like it's too much."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,146,"Bigger, bolder, and better than ever, the Avengers delivers smart, character-driven action-adventure sure to please audiences and break box office records."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,147,"Enjoyable at times, but there's just too much going on. Too many characters. Too many motivations. Too many weird allusions to things from previous movies that I barely remembered"
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,148,"Superheroes reteam for entertaining, action-packed sequel."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,149,Avengers strike again -- but not as deftly
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,150,"The law of diminishing returns strikes big-time in Avengers: Age of Ultron, an overstuffed mess of one-note characters, gaudy CGI, and bad one-liners."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,151,"Earth's Mightiest Heroes are back for a thrilling, fun and, dare I say it, darker film."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,152,"[Whedon is] a super-juggler. But on ""Age of Ultron,"" he seems to have lost control of some of the balls. The new movie succeeds, but falls short of his incredible achievement on 2012's ""The Avengers."""
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,153,The biggest battle is the one between writer-director Joss Whedon and the massed forces of Marvel Studios.
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,154,"You can't escape the feeling that Whedon and the gang are having a good time making the film, and want to share that glee with the audience. It's a franchise that has hit its rhythm."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,155,"The story is wider to the point of becoming unwieldy. But there is fun to be had here, as the heroes kid around with one another against the backdrop of mass destruction and mayhem."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,156,"If there is a more perfect movie out there, I don't know what it is."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,157,"It's like we're watching consecutive episodes of a very large, very expensive TV show. You might love the show, but it's not exactly an ""event"" every time it's on, you know?"
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,158,"Delivers as the epic summer blockbuster film of 2015 again and again. Avengers fans won't walk out the theater disappointed."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,159,A sense of the mechanical plagues this film.
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,160,"If at least nine lead characters get their due in dramatic arcs, quippy zingers, and superhero showmanship, it is inevitable that it will be cluttered."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,161,"Keep it comin', Joss."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,162,"The plot is simple and the movie doesn't live up to expectations. [full review in Spanish]"
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,163,"Tons of fun, easy to digest and just really enjoyable. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]"
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,164,It gives Marvel fans exactly what they want and more. [full review in Spanish]
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,165,"Yes, comic-book movies are crowding out everything else, are the eventual heat death of cinema, and so forth. But, man, there's just so much neat stuff here. Boom. Kapow."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,166,"Juggling movie stars, plot points and a massive amount of visual effects, Whedon manages to put together a sequel that is fast and funny. But befitting the robot of the title, this feels more like a machine than a movie."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,167,It is a good sequel that ends with the promise of a better and more entertaining MCU. [full review in Spanish]
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,168,"It's definitely an efficient blockbuster. You will enjoy yourself at the movie theater... However, it's the weakest entry of the last 3 Marvel movies. [full review in Spanish]"
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,169,"Overall, Avengers: Age of Ultron has everything fans have been waiting for. [FULL REVIEW IN SPANISH]"
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,170,The Avengers return in an epic adventure with a little romance and tragedy to keep the spectacle grounded.
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,171,Age of Ultron is not disappointing but it is definitely not better than the first one. [full review in Spanish]
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,172,"I began to forget the breathless, teetering, tottering, careening, catapulting Avengers: The Age Of Ultron about 20 minutes into its 141 minutes... Zoom, quip, wham, smirk, quip, blam! Quip! Oh so much too-muchness on an inhumane scale."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,173,"It is, in short, more disposable than the mere mortal blockbusters it was designed to outpace. This should defy Marvel Studios mathematics. How can a movie with more stuff than its predecessors be less fun?"
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,174,"The thing's a behemoth. And as the franchise thunders on, it's also becoming more and more a bore."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,175,"[The sequel] has drained most of the joy, fun, and life out of these characters."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,176,"As much as you admire the polished, expertly choreographed entertainment...you feel as if they're putting on a gymnastics display or an extremely high-tech tap-dance routine."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,177,"When this finally ended I had an appreciation for how it feels to be unjustly convicted of a crime...and be released after 10 years when it was discovered you were not guilty. Sure, it feels good to be free, but who's going to give you back your time?"
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,178,"Not everything about Age of Ultron works... But long stretches of it are as good as anything Marvel Studios has produced, suggesting a bolder, more ambitious vision for the studio going forward."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,179,"Though advertised as a darker and more brooding follow-up, the real surprise of Ultron is how much in line with the first film's tone and structural beats this is."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,180,"It exemplifies what Marvel has always done, which is make the superhuman more human."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,181,A Marvel blockbuster with more human touches than usual for this kind of fare.
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,182,"The amazing thing about Avengers: Age of Ultron is that it's reasonably enjoyable while feeling less like a movie than an epic sowing of seeds for multiple Marvel properties."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,183,"It's to Whedon's credit that, among all the fighting and property damage, he makes just enough time to focus on the personal lives of some of his characters, but not so much that the movie gets bogged down by it."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,184,"There's still a thrill in seeing all of these comic book characters together in a movie. Even when it's just Ulysses Klaw."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,185,"Age of Ultron disappoints not because it's irredeemably bad but because it fails to achieve the level of its predecessor in nearly every facet."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,186,"Whedon & Co. provide more than enough glib jokes, FX spectacles and sweet human insights to make Age of Ultron a popcorn must for the rest of us in need of a little comic-book wisdom right about now."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,187,"Whedon is still Whedon, and the grace notes -- the snappy patter, the team dynamics, the ""man, that was cool"" moments -- go a long way."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,188,Writer-director Joss Whedon attempts to inject just enough human drama into these noisy proceedings to keep it from turning into a Transformers-style crashathon.
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,189,"The basic gist is easy enough to follow, even if most of the battle scenes, shot in a barrage of quick cuts and extreme close-ups, feel like watching a rugby match from inside the ball."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,190,"That Ultron's vocal delivery packs in more fun and personality than the other characters tells us that ""Ultron"" misfires on more than one metaphorical gas-injected cylinder."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,191,"The film is a work of craft, from the actors like Mr. Downey, who can deliver a comic line with the timing of a mouse trap, to the editors, Jeffrey Ford and Lisa Lassek, upon whom so much of the movie's very elegant fluidity rests ..."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,192,"At this point the Marvel superhero movies are as machine-tooled as a Prius, and this one sticks closely to the blueprint that's made them box office titans."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,193,"You can sense that Mr. Whedon, having helped build a universal earnings machine with the first ""Avengers,"" has now struggled mightily, touchingly, to invest this behemoth with some life."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,194,"With Marvel's universe expanding and intertwining at an ever increasing rate, ""Age of Ultron"" feels less like a sequel than a cosmic event."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,195,"Regardless, this time with Avengers: Age of Ultron, our socks were only tugged on, halfway flopping off our collective toes, but never blown quite off."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,196,"More of the same, just not as good--lots of sound and fury (along with some Fury) signifying very little."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,197,"Whedon is as interested in how the team works under stress as he is in the way pavement cracks under the collective weight of the Hulk and Stark's Hulkbuster armor."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,198,"By making the Avengers snarky rivals as well as brothers and sisters in arms, franchise Big Brain Joss Whedon injects exactly what such a noisy spectacle needs: a dollop of charm."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,199,"As before, the greatest fun is in watching the original Avengers, all fine actors who've made the characters their own."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,200,"""Age of Ultron"" has self-aware laughs, grandiose themes and the best effects that money can buy. But at this point, it will take true vision to plot the umpteen sequels without getting trapped in a time loop."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,201,"Whedon's wit and invention are considerable...[but] the movies keep getting bigger, with diminishing returns. I find myself hoping against hope that Ant-Man will be really, really small."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,202,"As he did in the first ""Avengers,"" writer-director Joss Whedon avoids the fatal trap of comic-book self-seriousness, leavening a baggy, busy, overpopulated story with zippy one-liners, quippy asides and an overarching tone of jaunty good fun."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,203,"Spader is so charismatic, so purely, quietly and wittily nasty, that he provides a welcome contrast to the rote wisecracking of our heroes, who are so busy trying to one-up each others' punchlines that they are beginning to come off like ""Avengers' 11."""
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,204,"Joss Whedon again works out a way to make world-destroying forces colloquial, keeping the humanity in superhumans. Because of that humanism-it's a pessimistic film, certain that the sun is setting on the human race-Ultron works as mammoth entertainment."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,205,A whole bunch of blather leads up to the same old climax with imperiled innocents and massive destruction.
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,206,"Age of Ultron is a feast of visual delights, but plot wears thin. If Anthony Russo and Joe Russo (Captain America: The Winter Soldier), who are now taking over the Avengers series, want to keep the audience fully invested, some re-Assembly is required."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,207,"More bloated, but bolder than its predecessor, Avengers: Age of Ultron is every bit the 11th entry in Marvel's winning, world-dominating formula."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,208,"It's one you're going to want to see because when it shines, it shines bright, but Avengers: Age of Ultron is just a little worrying that the universe is already buckling under its own weight."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,209,"Okay as a diversion but nowhere close to matching any number of other singular superhero movies. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)"
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,210,"...the film starts out attempting to question the Avengers' place in the world and whether they really make a difference, only to forget to probe for an answer not long after the asking."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,211,"There seems to be a lot of pressure for Avengers: Age of Ultron to more than just a movie, which really hampers its ability to be a movie."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,212,"There is a significant lack of that human touch in Age of Ultron's very fabric, where the winning personalities of its core superheroes feel diminished, defeated and consumed by whatever algorithm keeps these movies going."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,213,"Joss Whedon has said that he's walking away from the Marvel universe after this, and after seeing Ultron, it makes sense; from the looks of things, this movie killed him."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,214,"Director Joss Whedon follows up his billion-dollar superhero smash the way most sequel makers try to up their game: by amping up everything everybody liked the first time around, plus more! More! More!"
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,215,"...a comic book movie, to be sure, but it's got enough spectacle, wit, and talent on display to make it a most entertaining kickoff to the season."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,216,"Black Widow chooses the Hulk over Thor? Females everywhere say ""Huh?"" The Avengers show absolutely no interest in each other. AGE OF ULTRON is soulless."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,217,"Talk about feeding the beast. Josh Whedon's never dull chapter in the franchise is practically bursting at its seams, relentlessly serving up just what the fans of this brand are expecting."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,218,"Age of Ultron can be a little unwieldy, but when it works, it works really well."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,219,An entertaining package of characters and ideas that manages to be a whole lot more than the first film while also being a little bit less.
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,220,The action scenes are spectacular. But the slightly jumbled story and mob of new characters pulls focus from what makes the film work the best -- the original group of costumed characters.
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,221,It is the product of a machine perfectly evolved for the sole purpose of annihilating boredom.
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,222,"Like the worst superhero movies, Avengers: Age of Ultron often feels like not-very-bright kids playing with action toys, holding them up by the ankles and making them fight or kiss or feud at whim and at length."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,223,"A middling film, yet it's so heavy with Joss Whedon's sweat that it never feels like a lazy cash-in --- which for a preordained summer megahit is an accomplishment."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,224,"Sometimes the super-heroism is just brightly colored junk food. And sometimes, it's a way of giving us a glimpse of how we flawed, messed-up, occasionally monstrous humans can sometimes prove ourselves worthy."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,225,"It would be silly to pretend that Avengers: Age of Ultron isn't good at what it does, that it's not proficient at delivering superhero thrills for those who crave them most."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,226,"Avengers: Age of Ultron may be very similar to the original film, but that's ok, for it still results in an equally thrilling ride."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,227,"The climactic act of ""Age of Ultron"" is full of colossal ka-booms and special effects, but it also has heft and reason and a bass-note of emotion."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,228,"It's a little overstuffed and a little overlong. One thing it's not, even a little, is disappointing."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,229,"Whedon has pulled off an impressive feat here, sustaining the intensity of a ripping adventure yarn while digging into a few of the characters a little more deeply, finding fresh ground to cover in a more satisfying epic."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,230,"Darker than its predecessor [and] far less witty ... Whereas Stark seemed to dominate the first film, here the emphasis is ... Hawkeye and Black Widow ... a negative in the case of Hawkeye and a huge positive in the case of Black Widow."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,231,Age of Ultron is all rush and sensation with little substance. But what a feeling.
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,232,"Like the first one, Avengers: Age of Ultron was written and directed by Joss Whedon, among whose many virtues is an indelible, infallible touch with character, which is important because in Ultron he has to introduce them at a furious rate."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,233,"Ultron is too full, of action and CGI, while also being nearly empty of genuine thrills. A talented cast impresses throughout, but the action ultimately overwhelms it."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,234,"Whedon is mostly up to the task of keeping all his balls in the air, though he's not above using some glib speechmaking and ridiculous action to divert your attention and keep your questions at bay."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,235,"This is Joss Whedon's riff on the trope of a darker sequel. Joss Whedon never met a cliche he couldn't deconstruct so this is a wonderful approach to a shared universe superhero team up."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,236,"""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" is supercharged and lifeless, frenetic and stone-cold dead, a barrage of action scenes that look fake, yet make you wonder if fake is the new real."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,237,"The movie's brain quickly catches up with its big body, and writer-director Joss Whedon tops his 2012 outing with a more emotional sequel."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,238,"Avengers: Age of Ultron has its problems, but on a visceral, pure enjoyment level audiences are going to walk away more than pleased."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,239,"An inferior sequel that brings little joy to its grandiosity, ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" carries the vague aroma of uninspired, box-checking functionality."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,240,"Joss Whedon brings along his ""A"" game for this installment, and it doesn't disappoint."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,241,The only thing that adequately distinguishes these films is the all-important banter that occurs during down time.
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,242,"An enjoyable, full-sensory superhero romp, it delivers no less than what one would expect from an Avengers film. At the same time, it delivers no more than that,either."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,243,"""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" brings the best of all the Marvel worlds for the first explosive superhero thrill-ride of the year."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,244,"Enough fight scenes and action sequences for three Marvel movies, but they are rather nondescript."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,245,"Spectacularly overstuffed - it's more spectacle than substance."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,246,"Joss Whedon and his heroes and villains epic offers more this time around -- more characters, more plot points, more action -- and a few reasons for concern."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,247,"Still light and funny, but the novelty's worn off, and the bloat and repetition are starting to show"
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,248,"There is much to like about ""The Avengers: Age of Ultron."" There was much to love about ""The Avengers,"" and therein lies the difference."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,249,"Writing and directing ""Avengers: Age of Ultron,"" Joss Whedon proves he has a superpower of his own: mediocrity."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,250,"Lovable characters, just the right amount of humor and spectacular action make ""Ultron"" a worthy bridge to whatever happens next in The Avengers' universe."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,251,"Age of Ultron is a Western about military service: it's a call to arms to protect American values like the family and the home from East European types and electronic threats to security systems."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,252,"[I] loved most of the exchanges between the characters. Appreciated the Avengers' attempts to avoid destruction in population centers. The action scenes were very exciting and clever, but I had trouble keeping up with the visuals."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,253,"Joss Whedon sets up the future of the Avengers for the Russo Brothers, but this is no longer exciting. It's exhausting."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,254,"Sure, this is the A Team of comic book superstars, but overextended sequences don't make them any more impressive."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,255,"Age of Ultron, then, shows what happens when an unstoppable force (Joss Whedon's imagination) meets an immovable object (the Disney/Marvel behemoth)."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,256,Joss Whedon shows his considerable gifts for multicharacter air traffic control in a massive 3-D spectacle while demonstrating reserves of insouciance.
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,257,It may not be the perfect sequel but it is an epic one.
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,258,"Whedon gets the elastic physical reality of comic books, and he knows how to frame a shot as though it were a splash panel come to life... But by the fifth digital showdown, the endless CGI spectacle begins to feel a little numbing."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,259,Ultron is slyly funny. And it manages to balance this sort of comedy (I hooted when the Hulk listens to Maria Callas on headphones) with the tendency towards the sort of whacko-labyrinthine operatic complexity inherent in comic books.
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,260,"No one can quibble with the efforts of the actors. Marvel cast well, and continues to expand their parts or add fascinating new players."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,261,"Everything [Whedon] did so well on the first meeting of these Marvel comic book creations he achieves once again, which makes for a movie both enjoyable and somewhat repetitive."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,262,"""Age of Ultron"" proves that a movie with stealth fighter jets, levitating cities and Hulk-on-robot fisticuffs can be as freewheeling as a no-budget indie."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,263,"Entertaining as much of ""Avengers 2"" is, especially when it's just hanging out with the gang in between scuffles (the ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" lesson, learned), Whedon's picture meets expectations without exceeding them."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,264,"Thin on story, crowded with characters and padded with extraneous action. In other words, a sure hit!"
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,265,"Ultron maintains Marvel's record for solid, entertaining blockbusters but falls down a bit in the ""making sense"" department."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,266,"Most of these characters are great fun, and there are still stories to tell. So why not do it, instead of telling and retelling the same tale, only bigger?"
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,267,"A lot of movie, where not a lot is special."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,268,"The film struggles against the rigid formula that typifies the Marvel universe, but only does so up to a point."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,269,"Its problems may not have been so evident if it wasn't trying so hard to surpass the far better movies that preceded it."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,270,"This movie is fine, honestly. I rather liked it."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,271,"Pure, uncut comic-book fantasy...Whedon tames the beast into something spectacularly epic, if a bit exhausting: bursting with destructive mayhem but grounded by interesting character beats, rife with dark implications but seasoned with good humor."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,272,"At times it feels like it's a few handfuls of terrific actors away from being a 'Transformers' entry."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,273,"While it does feel rushed, and the overabundance of characters threatens to impede the focus, I was constantly engaged with the strong dialogue, humor and breathtaking action."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,274,"It aims to please. And, for the most part, this superhero extravaganza hits the bull's-eye with all the precision of Jeremy Renner's arrow-slinging Hawkeye."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,275,"""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" is a kinetic, wicked mix of muscle and magic. Look no further if you want a world of superpowered freaks and geeks."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,276,"First, you try to understand what the hell is going on. Then you slowly realize that you will never understand what is going on. And, last, you wind up with the distinct impression that, if there was anything to understand, it wasn't worth the sweat."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,277,"Having bent the world to his will, Whedon, a modest and self-deprecating talent, has helped Marvel unleash a form of spectacle-laden blockbuster that, unfortunately, seems intent on obliterating what he does best."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,278,Whedon may still be a maverick but the Marvel behemoth proves an ever more levelling corporate force.
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,279,141 minutes of noise and incident.
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,280,"""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" lives up to the hype...it gets darker than the first, and still manages to be just as funny and action-packed."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,281,"The chemistry amongst our heroes is once again terrific to watch, and the action sequences deliver both thrills and laughs."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,282,It suffers from a bit of Transformersitis in laying on the action and effects too thick this time. The thrill may be gone in seeing these comic book icons together but the banter between them still works and it does have its moments of sheer fun.
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,283,"There are only so many superhero smackdowns a body can take before it all becomes biff bam bore... the film is most entertaining when it finds the Avengers kicking back rather than kicking off, hanging around off duty and indulging in locker-room banter ."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,284,"It was like Whedon thought about the 1st film and felt it wasn't deep enough, not realizing that its success was its comic book shallowness. It was just fun for audiences."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,285,"When it reaches its extended climax, however, Age of Ultron perfectly delivers huge action scenes with the requisite smaller heroic beats."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,286,"Whedon takes a few wrong turns, creating a jumble when the action gets too thick. But he recovers like a pro, devising a spectacle that's epic in every sense of the word."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,287,"When movies such as this come along which feel more like financial investments than stories, that's what you get: production line filmmaking in which human beings are incidental and even unnecessary in the face of computer-generated scale and spectacle."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,288,"No one needs to be told if he, or even she, likes superhero movies. If you like them at all, you'll adore Avengers: Age of Ultron."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,289,"Avengers: Age Of Ultron is smart, nimble and recognises that the one way to make yet more scenes of mass destruction involving is to give the story behind them a little heart."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,290,"Proves an action movie can have it all: smart without being convoluted, flashy without being shallow, fun without being hollow, and exciting without being dumb."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,291,"Despite a densely packed script chock-full of leading characters, there's rarely a moment where one is underplayed or ignored."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,292,"Although there are some longeurs when Whedon feels bound to plot a pathway to Marvel's next tranche of potential blockbusters, the witty repartee between stars at ease in their superhero skin leavens the odd lull."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,293,"When ten-cylinder push comes to jet-propelled shove, Whedon knows his audience, and supplies the required fireworks."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,294,"Like a magnificent cake sliced into too many slivers, the movie is at once too much and never quite enough."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,295,Whedon wastes no time teaming them up for a blistering opening sequence that is thrilling. Unfortunately that segment is a high point in a film that swiftly becomes an exercise in ever-diminishing returns bar a few moments.
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,296,"It's spectacular, yet can leave you exhausted."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,297,I walked out of the theater feeling like the survivor of an all-you-can-eat buffet.
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,298,"The fact that Marvel announced its entire slate a few months back takes a lot of the impact away. If we didn't know about a Black Panther film, the mention of Wakanda would have been mind-blowing. Instead, it fell flat."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,299,Any true drama is entirely missing. There is no tension. Everything has to stop for the next battle. It is tediously repetitive. And the characters are all one defining trait.
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,300,"Marvel consistently puts out entertaining films which work towards a common goal - which is why it's mystifying that Avengers: Age of Ultron, nominally the best entry in phase two, is only mildly entertaining by comparison."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,301,"The film-makers' understandable inability to take their own material seriously has now pushed the project beyond gentle parody and into broad pastiche."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,302,"Not without problems, but continues the Avengers tradition of big, bold blockbusters that don't need to toss away thoughtfulness to remain pure popcorn fun."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,303,"The movie's action sequences and sequel-baiting suck up much of its oxygen, and the magnitude of battles dwarf the smaller moments."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,304,"Filled with plenty of laughs, great spectacle, and more cool characters than you can poke Loki's sceptre at."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,305,"Even though moviegoers looking for nonstop action will get their wish, Avengers: Age of Ultron is really at its best when it's focusing on the characters."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,306,"In many ways, Marvel has grown up and passed Whedon by - and his jocular take on the material doesn't just feel stale, it feels like a step back."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,307,[N]ails the feeling of sitting and reading a stack of eight comics in one sitting
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,308,"Marvel's latest is its biggest, baddest installment yet, but it's the little moments that make it work - in part, because Joss Whedon is so good at them."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,309,"It's hard not to admire how efficiently and enjoyably the myriad elements have been threaded together; Age of Ultron is a suitably well-oiled machine with an insatiable appetite for family friendly destruction."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,310,A $250 million pile of poo.
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,311,"Avengers: Age of Ultron is a perfect example of the kind of crowd-pleasing blockbuster that audiences expect in this day and age, though I don't think it will achieve classic-status like the first film."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,312,"Whedon weaves theses titanic characters and egos together to bind the bloated universe into a Long Island Iced Tea; the more you savour, the more you come to appreciate all the powerful and seemingly conflicting elements and motivations working together."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,313,The symphony of destruction works because this blockbuster behemoth has an actual soul.
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,314,"Despite the overall enjoyment factor of the film, with this, its eleventh film, writer-director Joss Whedon seems intent on pushing some of Marvel Films' more tiresome elements to the extreme."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,315,"Avengers: Age Of Ultron is a big, bold, funny, thrilling, absorbing triumph, and continues Marvel Studios' seeming push for world cinematic domination."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,316,"Avengers: Age of Ultron, is a letdown -- entertaining to a degree, but so overstuffed that it may mark the point of diminishing returns for the Marvel movies generally."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,317,"While the visuals are extraordinary and the wry humour is welcome, what's missing is a coherent story with light and shade"
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,318,"You'd be surprised how much slack you'll cut a film that features superheroes gently ribbing one another for 142 minutes."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,319,"Fortunately, returning director Joss Whedon understands how to craft a superhero movie just as well as Marvel knows how to sell one."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,320,"Avengers: Age of Ultron delivers the usual superhero suspects in a slick, if overlong, adventure that bungee jumps between banter and action."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,321,"Whedon brings a depth and wit to his storytelling that you will never find in a Transformers movie. Even so, the final showdown is a little anti-climactic."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,322,"It's hard to muster the attention span to care about Earth's Mightiest Heroes when we know they'll just be back to do it all again in a few years."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,323,"A welcome return of the Avengers amusing team dynamic and essentially asking ""what more could you want?"""
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,324,"An entertaining compromise. Overloaded, but the execution of intimate character moments shine in what's essentially a bridging film"
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,325,"While ""Avengers: Age Of Ultron"" isn't perfect, and arguably less successful than ""The Avengers,"" on a purely enjoyable moviegoing level, it should please fans hardcore and casual alike, and that's maybe that's all that really matters in the end."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,326,"In the moments where it all comes together, like the sure-to-be-iconic Hulkbuster sequence, this is the very model of what Marvel's been chasing since day one."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,327,"Avengers: Age of Ultron plays like an obligation, a box to be checked off on a list before all parties move onto the things they really want to do."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,328,"It looks great, but haven't we been here before?"
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,329,"Marvel movie die-hards will come away having found nuggets of pleasure, but those who complain about superhero sagas will find plenty to support their arguments here."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,330,"Ultimately, Avengers: Age of Ultron can't recapture the charm and majesty of seeing Earth's Mightiest Heroes assembled for the first time. That said, it's still a lot of fun and offers plenty of great action and character moments."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,331,"The result is a lot of everything, but the film never feels overcrowded: in fact, it's the interplay between the film's many different characters, rather than the blow-up-the-world crisis they're trying to defuse, that keeps you on the edge of your seat."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,332,"Giddy good fun as the Marvel movies consistently are-Age of Ultron's many battles swoop and clang nicely-they're no longer novel."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,333,"It's a superhero cavalcade of energy and fun."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,334,"Bigger and, yes, darker than the first, this is less air-punchingly gleeful but probably more consistent."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,335,"It doesn't have the fist-pumping highs of the first film, but AGE OF ULTRON is deeper, more emotional and all-around better."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,336,"There's a lot to like about Age of Ultron, but the coolest thing about it is the way it reclaims the comic book part of the phrase 'comic-book movie.'"
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,337,"Avengers: Age of Ultron succeeds in the top priority of creating a worthy opponent for its superheroes and giving the latter a few new things to do, but this time the action scenes don't always measure up ..."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,338,"Whedon and his large, capable cast (even larger for this follow-up) deliver enough adventure, laughs and flat-out spectacle to ensure that audiences will feel as if they have gotten their money's worth ..."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,339,It ticks all the boxes for a summer blockbuster but you feel spandex fatigue is just being to creep into the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,340,"There is so much going on in Avengers: Age of Ultron ... it feels like a minor miracle that not only the film makes sense, but that it's also somehow enjoyable."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,341,"Anchored by Whedon's trademark wit without becoming a tiresome zinger-fest, it's a thrilling and affable slice of impeccably crafted chaos."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,342,"As gargantuan as blockbusters come ... doubles down on action, sarcasm, and reference-heavy plot."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,343,"If you're happy to, as they say, just turn your brain off and watch your heroes fight, it's fine...But Marvel has set me up to expect stories a bit above that base level"
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,344,"It has a definite mid-season feel to it, telling a compelling but never game-changing story while laying the foundations for the epic, two-part Infinity War due in 2018."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,345,"If this is what the apotheosis of branded, big-studio entertainment has come to look like in 2015, we could be doing much worse. Unlike its title character, ""Age of Ultron"" most definitely has soul."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,346,"Massive, immersive and wildly entertaining, Age of Ultron gets the gang back together for a globe-trotting battle against a meager villain. Fun will be had by all."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,347,"Improves on its predecessor on many fronts even if it doesn't fully recapture the magic of the 2012 endeavour."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,348,"Age of Ultron [is] one of the most thoughtfully driven monster vehicles you are likely to see in a summer rammed with powerful, glossy, mechanised beasts."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,349,"A gooey plate of nachos that shouldn't constitute your whole diet, but is perfectly enjoyable for now, even when it congeals at the end into a wet, sloppy mess."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,350,"It is likely that this is the best Avengers movie that we'll ever see."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,351,"James Spader, another living, breathing reason we need a special award for voice work and casting at the Oscars because he was just the perfect choice for everything that Ultron had to offer and performed it incredibly."
AgeofUltron,AgeofUltron_rm,352,"The stakes on the line in this action adventure are not only sky-high but soul-deep. Whedon hits both points with an almighty wallop, resulting in a large canvas blockbuster that is as epic as it is profound."
Antman,Antman_rm,0,No other Marvel installment has felt as weighed down by its obligations to the franchise.
Antman,Antman_rm,1,"[Ants are] pests, and that's just a weird place to start for a superhero, especially if he never strays too far from his origins."
Antman,Antman_rm,2,At long last Marvel Studios offers up a superhero smaller than its artistic ambitions.
Antman,Antman_rm,3,"The overwhelming, self-serious sense that we are watching something Very Important blissfully doesn't exist in Ant-Man. It's just plain fun: light, breezy, simple and enjoyable."
Antman,Antman_rm,4,"What, if anything, holds ""Ant-Man"" together? First, Paul Rudd, who is laughably unheroic, and has the grace to know as much ..."
Antman,Antman_rm,5,"It's difficult to shake the sense that the film was assembled hurriedly and somewhat haphazardly. Which, from all available evidence, is exactly what happened."
Antman,Antman_rm,6,"Making the best of a bad creative situation, Ant-Man has emerged unexpectedly as the best non-superhero superhero film in cinemas. Marvel's next film has big shoes to fill."
Antman,Antman_rm,7,"Ant-Man is entertaining for what it is, but is average on the scale of all the Marvel films so far. Its action is fantastic, Ant-Man's abilities pretty cool, and the setup for future films solid enough."
Antman,Antman_rm,8,Part of what makes Ant-Man work is they have assembled an incredibly charismatic and likable cast.
Antman,Antman_rm,9,"Despite the suit and the Lilliputian size, Rudd manages to be his likeable self, which compensates when the action lags."
Antman,Antman_rm,10,Marvel ups the ant-e with easily one of the funniest superhero movies yet.
Antman,Antman_rm,11,"After an hour or so of mediocrity, things really click into place; the action becomes more playful and inventive, and the actors start to let loose."
Antman,Antman_rm,12,"Yes, there's action and there's geekery but more than anything, there's just a whole lot of fun."
Antman,Antman_rm,13,"This is an origin story with plenty of origin, but also a sly kind of humor that sometimes gets pushed aside in all these comic book films."
Antman,Antman_rm,14,"[Marvel keeps creating] excellent female characters, then com[ing] up with reasons why they cannot be the primary protagonist."
Antman,Antman_rm,15,"Ant-Man may have a hero who is often small, but the movie is always big fun."
Antman,Antman_rm,16,"The cast is fun, the tone is light ... It may not be the pre-imminent quality film in all of the MCU, but I don't think it meant to be."
Antman,Antman_rm,17,"It will take more than a gigantic can of Raid to destroy the indomitable presence of Ant-Man and what his hedonistic heroics, both physical and psychological, bring to the prized picnic table."
Antman,Antman_rm,18,"Ant-Man doesn't change the wheel for superhero films, but it's certainly a lot of fun and a welcome addition to the MCU."
Antman,Antman_rm,19,"Fun characters, relatable stakes, and lots of laughs."
Antman,Antman_rm,20,"It's deceptively exciting, genuinely funny, and has a nostalgic aura about it that harkens back to the campy/serious Jack Kirby days of Marvel Comics."
Antman,Antman_rm,21,"Thankfully, even the weakest in the Marvel collection turns out to be fairly entertaining, proving that ultimately, the size of the hero really doesn't matter at all."
Antman,Antman_rm,22,Encourages us to see the excitement and valor in little things.
Antman,Antman_rm,23,Ant-Man feels like a breath of fresh air for this gargantuan franchise.
Antman,Antman_rm,24,"Led by a solid ensemble, Ant-Man brings a lot of fun into the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
Antman,Antman_rm,25,"The movie will probably be hit or miss for some, but it doesn't leave you with a bad taste for the genre."
Antman,Antman_rm,26,Most Marvel movies are too much. This one is just enough.
Antman,Antman_rm,27,"It's not bad, but it's definitely a movie that has lost its way in the process of business/movie making. You can see what this movie could have been. You'll still enjoy it, it's just a shame."
Antman,Antman_rm,28,"By the sweet hammer of Thor, Marvel Comics has really, really run out of ideas this time."
Antman,Antman_rm,29,"...it feels like a simpler, smaller movie, which couldn't be more appropriate, considering the powers of its protagonist. [Full review in Spanish]"
Antman,Antman_rm,30,... a breath of fresh air... [Full review in Spanish]
Antman,Antman_rm,31,"Yes, it's funny at times and nearly always entertaining but, helped by a terrific cast and a thoughtfully constructed screenplay, Ant-Man has enough gravitas and drama to keep an open-minded adult audience entertained, alongside its target younger market."
Antman,Antman_rm,32,"Every detail, both big (Michael Douglas) and small (Pea), works to alter our perceptions of we mean when we talk about this genre and those crazy expectations."
Antman,Antman_rm,33,"Ant-Man is a very enjoyable movie on its own merit. Paul Rudd's everyman charm is put to good use as Scott Lang, but Michael Pena walks away with the best parts of the movie as Scott's former cell mate, Luis."
Antman,Antman_rm,34,"As the closing piece of Marvel's hit-and-miss phase two, Ant-Man bodes well for the future of the MCU."
Antman,Antman_rm,35,"Overall, this is a decent start to another franchise, and it doesn't matter whether you like it or not. Ant-Man will be back in next year's Captain America: Civil War."
Antman,Antman_rm,36,"Ant-Man stands on its own as an entertaining, smartly funny film, while also fitting neatly into the Marvel cinematic universe."
Antman,Antman_rm,37,"Ultimately, Ant-Man isn't the best of what the Marvel Cinematic Universe has to offer, but it's no train wreck either."
Antman,Antman_rm,38,Ant-Man is undoubtedly one of the best individual superhero movies on the MCU. [Full review in Spanish]
Antman,Antman_rm,39,"Despite its absurd romantic storyline, and creepy crawlers, Ant-Man is a superhero film worth seeing. I don't think I've laughed so hard in any other Marvel film."
Antman,Antman_rm,40,"It's the snappy dialogue, appealing, broadly drawn characters, and imaginative use of the shrinking gimmick that make Ant-Man stand out."
Antman,Antman_rm,41,"Ant-Man is... funny, effortlessly charming, often genuinely weird, and possessed of a few strikingly original and/or emotional moments. It works."
Antman,Antman_rm,42,"Ant-Man is solid, mid-tier Marvel: nothing spectacular, but entertaining enough. Proceed accordingly."
Antman,Antman_rm,43,"Ant-Man is a surprisingly nimble, enjoyable origin story with a little-guy-saves-the-day quality that will particularly appeal to younger viewers."
Antman,Antman_rm,44,"Is Ant-Man worth seeing? (As if my answer matters; like all Marvel movies, it'll make a mint.) Sort of."
Antman,Antman_rm,45,"The plot is as basic as it gets and in its antagonist-protagonist set-up, almost an exact copy of the Spider-Man-Green Goblin situation. But who cares? When you have a cast delivering comedy this strong, plot would only get in the way."
Antman,Antman_rm,46,"Ant-Man is at least entertaining without overwhelming, and funny without the pomposity of the recent Marvel onslaught."
Antman,Antman_rm,47,"Combined with action that shifts the usual Marvel macro battle to micro dazzle, a solid cast and a high-tech heist of a plot, Ant-Man delivers a good thing in a small package."
Antman,Antman_rm,48,"""Ant-Man"" is far too restrained to stand out amongst its peers, too careful to leave a lasting mark of its own. Its pleasures are real, but nearly as small as its hero."
Antman,Antman_rm,49,"The previous anonymity of miniature-sized superhero who dates back to the 60s, doesn't prevent it from becoming one of the most entertaining and successful combinations of action and comedy in the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
Antman,Antman_rm,50,"Funny, engaging and entertaining, Marvel's latest superhero movie is by far their most kid-friendly. While there is scary action galore, it comes in managable comprehensible bites and Paul Rudd's Scott Lang/Ant-Man is a genial character."
Antman,Antman_rm,51,"Rudd is indeed the right man for the job, for at all times he seems at peace with himself, wearing a slightly mischievous grin and speaking in soft tones that make you want to pour your heart out to him as if he were your very old friend."
Antman,Antman_rm,52,"So Ant-Man is an admirable but flawed attempt to expand the Marvel canon. The script is far from Marvel's best and, considering the film aims to be light hearted, lacks the laughs that bolster so many of these films."
Antman,Antman_rm,53,"Delighting with inventive setpieces and an affable lead in Paul Rudd, Ant-Man is eccentric enough to amuse, but can often feel watered-down in execution."
Antman,Antman_rm,54,"Michael Pea is striking that Ant-Man and makes it clear that is humor, not imposed seriousness of the Avengers, that will keep us faithful to the superhero genre. [Full review in Spanish]"
Antman,Antman_rm,55,"This movie proves that fans should wait until a movie is released before passing judgment. Based on the behind the scenes drama this should have been a disaster, instead the little movie that could Triumphs!"
Antman,Antman_rm,56,"Ant-Man is a largely self-contained, breezy, hilarious and gorgeous heist film that manages a feat few recent superhero films do: It stands up well on its own."
Antman,Antman_rm,57,"Ant-Man marks the culmination of Marvel's ""Phase Two"" and they've brought the chapter to a close in likeable style."
Antman,Antman_rm,58,"There really isn't anything Paul Rudd can't do."
Antman,Antman_rm,59,"Even when it looks as if it might drop the ball, Marvel scores another touchdown with this fantastically fun film."
Antman,Antman_rm,60,"The best moments satirise the grand action sequences we've become accustomed to in these tentpoles."
Antman,Antman_rm,61,"The result is one of Marvel's most purely enjoyable movies to date."
Antman,Antman_rm,62,"Ant-Man has its charms, but they're frequently lost beneath a story that feels like a patchwork job. It's a fun watch, but also a frustrating one."
Antman,Antman_rm,63,"Rudd's humorously self-deprecating persona works wonders with the material and he gets terrific support from Michael Pea, who takes [a] stereotypical Latino sidekick role... and makes it fizz with good-natured fun."
Antman,Antman_rm,64,"Ant-Man is a highly-entertaining romp that boasts outstanding special effects and thrilling action sequences, turning this tiny hero into a big-screen success."
Antman,Antman_rm,65,"The same tepid, timeworn routine with a few chocolate sprinkles of 'fun' on top. ... Marvel has become its own antonym."
Antman,Antman_rm,66,"It functions well as a comedy, and light hearted fantasy, while channeling the spirit of classic Marvel tropes of the underdog, redemption, and the construction of an avenger."
Antman,Antman_rm,67,"In these playful moments, it feels as if we're watching a sly spoof of a typical Marvel film; but then the film reverts to more predictable blockbuster fare."
Antman,Antman_rm,68,"Like a super-powered heist movie, mixing fantastic invention with a tried, tested and all-too-familiar formula."
Antman,Antman_rm,69,"As fun as you expect from Marvel, but really misses Edgar Wright."
Antman,Antman_rm,70,"Marvel's signature gigantism is reversed with agreeable results."
Antman,Antman_rm,71,"One of the biggest pleasures is its overall subversion of the superhero genre. It still feels like a Marvel product, and it suffers from a typically one-dimensional bad guy, but it also has a lot of fun turning expectation on its head."
Antman,Antman_rm,72,any film that references The Incredible Shrinking Man so beautifully deserves its moment on the stage.
Antman,Antman_rm,73,"What is somewhat surprising is just how hilarious it actually is, even becoming a challenger to last year's laugh-fest Guardians Of The Galaxy in terms of impressive comedic chops."
Antman,Antman_rm,74,"Ant-Man's best quality is that it doesn't try to be a superhero movie yet it endulges all the craziness in them. [Full review in Spanish]"
Antman,Antman_rm,75,"It may boast the world's smallest superhero but Marvel's Ant-Man is big on fun and ingenuity."
Antman,Antman_rm,76,"Divertido, mas esquecvel."
Antman,Antman_rm,77,"When you get right down to it, there is something rather amusing about watching a protagonist the size of a fingernail doing ambitious stunt work while he attempts to survive dangerous obstacles."
Antman,Antman_rm,78,Ant-Man is entertaining because it uses big-movie tricks without big-movie hyperbole.
Antman,Antman_rm,79,"Pick a formula. Include a wonderful actor. Make everything work in spite of the unoriginality that's working against it. You get ""Ant-Man."""
Antman,Antman_rm,80,It is fun and frothy and convinces as a worthy part of the Marvel canon.
Antman,Antman_rm,81,For once the bad buzz and worse trailers were wrong. This hero deserves a movie all his own.
Antman,Antman_rm,82,"Peyton Reed's Ant-Man is, by the very nature of its subject, a smaller and consequently far more enjoyable enterprise."
Antman,Antman_rm,83,The weakest Marvel movie since The Incredible Hulk.
Antman,Antman_rm,84,"...it's becoming more and more apparent that Marvel simply has no idea what they're doing within the blockbuster genre."
Antman,Antman_rm,85,"Director Peyton Reed has a lot of fun with the concept, though epic battles on tiny scales can be a bit less breathtaking."
Antman,Antman_rm,86,"Ant-Man is this year's Guardians of the Galaxy. It focuses on a peripheral, wisecracking member of the Marvel Universe, adding a generous dose of humor to its superhero action."
Antman,Antman_rm,87,"Cheeky, good-natured, clever and even a little on the subversive side, Ant-Man is that rarest of comic-book movies -- one that manages to be personal and doesn't take itself too seriously."
Antman,Antman_rm,88,"Both an entertaining and eminently disposable superhero movie, Ant-Man rounds out Marvel Studios' much-vaunted 'Phase Two' of its masterplan to maintain world domination of mainstream cinema."
Antman,Antman_rm,89,"I'm not entirely convinced the character will mix well into the overall Marvel Cinematic Universe when he inevitably starts to crossover into other superhero films, but as a standalone adventure, ""Ant-Man"" is undeniably entertaining."
Antman,Antman_rm,90,Might be the biggest surprise of the summer.
Antman,Antman_rm,91,"Here comes Ant-Man, bringing all the surprise and joy we got when we wandered into the first Iron Man or Guardians of the Galaxy. And fun! Yes, fun."
Antman,Antman_rm,92,Paul Rudd rules.
Antman,Antman_rm,93,"The film has a nice mix of action, drama and comedy, aided by a very effective villain, Darren Cross (Corey Stoll of 'Non-Stop') who is a lot like the evil corporate character that Jeff Bridges played in 'Iron Man.'"
Antman,Antman_rm,94,...fails to have enough fun with its one unique element: the sense of scale.
Antman,Antman_rm,95,"The most typical film yet made in the now 12-picture Marvel Cinematic Universe. It is up to the individual viewer to decide if that's a compliment or a vicious & lacerating criticism."
Antman,Antman_rm,96,"At the end of the day Ant-Man ranks as one of the franchise's better efforts"
Antman,Antman_rm,97,"Next to Guardians of the Galaxy, Ant-Man is easily the most enjoyable, unashamedly fun and least pretentious superhero film to emerge from the computer-generated clutter of the Marvel movie universe."
Antman,Antman_rm,98,Extracts from the Disney attractions are dreadful but personality wins the day in this light duty superhero tale.
Antman,Antman_rm,99,treads the line between the funny and the exciting with notable dexterity
Antman,Antman_rm,100,"Rudd's Lang is refreshingly self-effacing and charming. Pena is flat-out hilarious."
Antman,Antman_rm,101,"A breezy affair that will give you your money's worth for two hours."
Antman,Antman_rm,102,Ant-Man symbolises American accomplishment. It is about people transcending the physical limitations of the human body and it is also a comedy variation on the political idea that the smallest person can change the world.
Antman,Antman_rm,103,"To say the least, this is a movie with a few bugs in it."
Antman,Antman_rm,104,Light and entertaining.
Antman,Antman_rm,105,"Like its predecessor, ""Guardians of the Galaxy,"" ""Ant-Man"" plays with the Marvel universe without upending it. It manages to make fun of the superhero genre while still fully embracing the emotions that make the genre powerful."
Antman,Antman_rm,106,"Two father/daughter stories - with splashy simulations, using macro-photography and motion-capture technology."
Antman,Antman_rm,107,"Thanks to a perfectly cast leading role by Paul Rudd​ and a hilarious supporting choice in Michael Pea​, ""Ant-Man​"" is a much funner-than-expected summer blockbuster that's as kid-friendly as it gets for the superhero genre."
Antman,Antman_rm,108,"A heist movie at heart, where the safecracker can also shrink to the size of an ant, it's got a true lightness of touch that makes it compelling and even heart-warming."
Antman,Antman_rm,109,"For the second straight year, Marvel's late-summer entry is an inventive, very enjoyable action film."
Antman,Antman_rm,110,Fun [but] it lacks both the artistic touch and character traces that would have transformed it from an episode into a movie.
Antman,Antman_rm,111,"Neither exciting action movie nor exuberantly silly comedy in the vein of Guardians, Ant-Man is mildly amusing but frankly a little dull; essential viewing only for Marvel completists ..."
Antman,Antman_rm,112,"This is a film that never loses sight of its title character, even when that character literally falls between the cracks."
Antman,Antman_rm,113,"Fast-paced, character-based, and appreciably energetic."
Antman,Antman_rm,114,"The balance is just right: hanging a lantern on the silly stuff but not dwelling on it for too long, while making sure the plot feels high-stakes and the characters believable."
Antman,Antman_rm,115,"Not so f-ant-astic, then, just a little ant-iclimatic."
Antman,Antman_rm,116,The film is transcendental-meditation low-key and just too damned nice.
Antman,Antman_rm,117,"Macro-Marvel ... wisely marketed at the small fry. It's closer to 'Antz' than the mutant radioactive variety (in 'Them!')."
Antman,Antman_rm,118,"A rapid-fire superhero adventure, 'Ant-Man' earns a place alongside Marvel Studios' other superhero movies."
Antman,Antman_rm,119,"A ridiculous, overacted, confusing and too talky but audience friendly comic book thriller from Marvel Comics."
Antman,Antman_rm,120,"Just in time, the first time Ant-Man shrinks down to ant size, it's such a wonder of marvelous CGI magic that everyone in the theater wakes up like an alarm has gone off."
Antman,Antman_rm,121,"It's certainly competent and amusing when need be, but not much more than that."
Antman,Antman_rm,122,"After the overkill of Avengers: Age of Ultron, it's nice to see Marvel return to a comparatively small-scale effort -- in more ways than one."
Antman,Antman_rm,123,"Marvel delivers once again...it'd be nice to see more (story) innovation before it becomes too obvious the same plot structure keeps getting beautiful new coats of paint."
Antman,Antman_rm,124,"With a lighter delivery coming with plenty of tongue-in-cheek humor, ""Ant-Man"" plays friendlier and more fun than the darker slate of superhero movies coming down the pike."
Antman,Antman_rm,125,"Ant-Man is a lark. It's a lighthearted, human-scaled matinee adventure that feels like an antidote to this summer's dour Avengers: Age of Ultron and its droning marathon of destruction."
Antman,Antman_rm,126,"A formidable character with high stakes and global consequences, partly by rooting it firmly in a post-Avengers world."
Antman,Antman_rm,127,"Is it a winner? The answer's yes, but only if you consider not losing to be winning."
Antman,Antman_rm,128,"This is the sort of movie where you see the effort and say, Thank god."
Antman,Antman_rm,129,"Ant-Man has all the right parts, but in Ultron's wake and at the forefront of a long upcoming lineup of films, it really is time for Marvel to start doing better."
Antman,Antman_rm,130,A formulaic Marvel superhero origin tale but Ant-Man gets a boost from a good ensemble cast and an overall tone of fun and creativity from director Peyton Reed.
Antman,Antman_rm,131,"While Ant-Man may not have mastered giving its hero a soul, it reminds us that you can still have a blast at the movies even when the good guy and bad guy are having a life-or-death fight that can be contained inside a briefcase."
Antman,Antman_rm,132,"'Ant-Man' is a blast. It is funny, clever and its view of the world in miniature is often spectacular."
Antman,Antman_rm,133,"It's enjoyable enough. The current critical buzz, about how it starts slow but ends strong, unlike so many other superhero-origin films, is relativism gone slightly mad."
Antman,Antman_rm,134,"These mini superheroes and villains are as serious as Captain America is earnest, which brings the funny when they're shown to scale."
Antman,Antman_rm,135,"The combination of a charismatic lead, a solid supporting cast, and the debut and dramatization of a new (to moviegoers) superpower (or two) has proved a winning formula for Marvel Studios for the last, oh, 10 or so films now, and it's no different here."
Antman,Antman_rm,136,Ant-Man is a pleasant surprise for this summer and one of the best films from Marvel and Disney. [full review in Spanish]
Antman,Antman_rm,137,"Ranks, on every front, as one of the best from Marvel's universe!"
Antman,Antman_rm,138,"With the likable Paul Rudd buffed up to portray Scott Lang, former cat burglar-turned-superhero, ""Ant-Man"" has a self-deprecating and witty edge."
Antman,Antman_rm,139,"In the end, Ant-Man is a film that entertains, thrills and closes Phase 2 of the MCU in a dignified way. [full review in Spanish]"
Antman,Antman_rm,140,"""It feels like the lead up to Yellowjacket was all cut out. I hope that's the case. Honestly, I expected him to say 'mwahaha' at one point."""
Antman,Antman_rm,141,"We've had so many superhero movies in the last decade that it's amazing one can still feel surprising. Ant-Man does. In that sense, it's a triumph."
Antman,Antman_rm,142,You walk in with no expectations and leave satisfied. [full review in Spanish]
Antman,Antman_rm,143,"In its medium-stupid and mismanaged fashion it's not so awful."
Antman,Antman_rm,144,"Ant-Man's unlikely charm is just enough to stop it from being squished at the cinematic picnic."
Antman,Antman_rm,145,"Ant-Man just isn't that great an idea and the film exists only because the Marvel machine is working so remorselessly through its massive back catalogue."
Antman,Antman_rm,146,"While boasting all the dazzling special effects we've come to expect from the Iron Man, Captain America and Thor series, this is Marvel in modest form - and small turns out to be beautiful."
Antman,Antman_rm,147,"The film isn't terrible but it makes earlier Marvel outings look like masterpieces. There's hardly a trope in it you haven't seen before, and done with far greater flair. It feels like making a mountain out of an anthill."
Antman,Antman_rm,148,"When the essence of a story is shrinking (and enlarging), the computer-generated effects department had better be on top form, and here, predictably, they are."
Antman,Antman_rm,149,"I enjoyed ""Ant-Man"" most as small-scale spectacle, a high-tech update on ""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"" cinema...The plot, it must be said, rewards not thinking about it."
Antman,Antman_rm,150,Marvel wins big by going small in its latest adventure.
Antman,Antman_rm,151,"One could take a magnifying glass to ""Ant-Man,"" but the results would be disastrous. This is a superhero movie to be enjoyed in the moment."
Antman,Antman_rm,152,"The result is a lighter, more overtly comedic effort than most Marvel films, and Wright's influence is still all over the finished product."
Antman,Antman_rm,153,"Go Ant-Man, more fun than the last Avengers movie by a long shot. Converted 3D still looks awful, however."
Antman,Antman_rm,154,"A fairly straightforward, conventional superhero story, where a mere mortal gathers the ability to be extraordinary and then becomes a hero. This is no way to sell me on a story about a guy who can make himself the size of an ant."
Antman,Antman_rm,155,A rousing 3-D sci-fi adventure that celebrates the teamwork between a man on an important mission and a band of insects.
Antman,Antman_rm,156,"The cast is better than solid. Directed by Peyton Reed, the action is a zippy pleasure. The more Scott shrinks, the bigger the fun. The visual effects are witty, especially when he begins making allies of various ant colonies."
Antman,Antman_rm,157,"It's exactly what the MCU needs right now: a creative dose of fun."
Antman,Antman_rm,158,"Clever, funny, cool Marvel movie has lots of sci-fi action."
Antman,Antman_rm,159,"Rudd's charm and easygoing sense of humor keeps us engaged, even though 'Ant-Man' is the least clever and ambitious of the recent spate of Marvel movies."
Antman,Antman_rm,160,"Unlike the two-dimensional pages of a comic book, and unlike it's two-dimensional Marvel Comics movie character cousins, Ant-Man is three-dimensional fun."
Antman,Antman_rm,161,"In more ways than one, ""Ant-Man"" is smaller than most of the rest of the MCU. The fate of the world is not immediately at stake, and that's a refreshing change."
Antman,Antman_rm,162,"The increasingly stale Marvel formula gets a blast of fresh air in this rollocking adventure movie, which combines a steady stream of character-based comedy with action sequences that are integrated seamlessly into the plot."
Antman,Antman_rm,163,"Ant-Man is a load of a fun, a light-hearted superhero heist film with a sense of humor and playfulness that will make you forget just how silly the whole thing is."
Antman,Antman_rm,164,"If you're worn out by superhero movies featuring apocalyptic battles in which cities are leveled, may I present ""Ant-Man,"" in which the climactic showdown takes place aboard a Thomas the Tank Engine train set. And not even the deluxe version."
Antman,Antman_rm,165,"It might take another Ant-Man movie (you know it's in the works) to see his character grow once the suit's luster has worn down, but the framework is there to create an interesting superhero."
Antman,Antman_rm,166,"I always thought this was the dumbest idea ever, and I was wrong."
Antman,Antman_rm,167,"The best thing about ""Ant-Man"" is that is starts small and stays that way."
Antman,Antman_rm,168,"Ant-Man isn't much more than pleasant (Peyton Reed directs limply), but anything Marvel that doesn't feel Marvel-ish makes me smile."
Antman,Antman_rm,169,"Not just one of the more entertaining Marvel movies - infinitely better than Joss Whedon's overstuffed Avengers: Age of Ultron - but a genuinely fun and clever deconstruction of the genre, too."
Antman,Antman_rm,170,"For a small movie, ""Ant-Man"" has a lot going on. Rudd makes it work."
Antman,Antman_rm,171,"Yes, it's fine, but not much more than that. Which is good news for Marvel, which must have wondered if it had an Ant problem."
Antman,Antman_rm,172,"'Ant-Man' will appeal mostly to ant-people. Translated: children. Factor in fans of Paul Rudd and Marvel superheroes, and you could have a box office community picnic."
Antman,Antman_rm,173,"Taking itself seriously without being too serious, the film proves fun all the same, confirming that it is possible to side with a superhero who is the size of a fingertip without once feeling the need to laugh at him."
Antman,Antman_rm,174,"Guaranteed to feature 2015's best climactic battle atop a train set -- pardon the terrible pun -- 'Ant-Man' is freaking f-ANT-astic fun and the year's most pleasant surprise."
Antman,Antman_rm,175,"Not the Marvel misfire that fans of the titular tiny guy might have expected, but it's still lumpy and trifling."
Antman,Antman_rm,176,"There's a decent amount of fun to be had... But considering Marvel's stellar track record and the comedic wonderfulness of its star, Paul Rudd, Ant-Man is more than a little disappointing."
Antman,Antman_rm,177,"I wish the film had gone even further into loopiness. Like Ant-Man, the film, directed by Peyton Reed, comes in two sizes -- it's sometimes big on laughs but often small on risk-taking."
Antman,Antman_rm,178,"Tou don't need to know the Avengers from the Justice League to enjoy this weird romp starring Paul Rudd as Scott Lang, a burglar with a heart of gold."
Antman,Antman_rm,179,"The result is a film not quite sure of itself, like it's wearing clothes a size too big."
Antman,Antman_rm,180,"The thing has got big laughs, a real heartbeat, and a modesty of scale that, next to the mega machinery of most Marvel movies, is kind of a relief."
Antman,Antman_rm,181,Ant-Man is fun but surprisingly conventional.
Antman,Antman_rm,182,While its shrunken special effects are stunning its screenplay is overloaded with melodrama and an unreasonable amount of unfunny humor.
Antman,Antman_rm,183,"There's nothing snarky or air quote-ish about the story, but there is a recognition that this is a superhero the size of a grain of rice. In this case, that's super enough."
Antman,Antman_rm,184,"Another cog in the Marvel machine, it runs smoothly, with Douglas providing the necessary gravitas and Stoll giving emotional viability to his unbalanced villain."
Antman,Antman_rm,185,"Although its origin-story machinations get the better of it, Ant-Man isn't a bust."
Antman,Antman_rm,186,"The attempts at overt comedy are hit-and-miss. The heist elements are derivative and not nearly as inventive as one might expect given the possibilities. The action sequences are variable and the dramatic moments... the less said, the better."
Antman,Antman_rm,187,"Ant-Man does some things very well, like letting Paul Rudd inhabit a comic-book character in precisely the same way Iron Man put a goatee on Robert Downey Jr. and called him Tony Stark."
Antman,Antman_rm,188,"Mostly the film keeps to the lighter side, aided by Michael Pea in a comic-even-more-relief role, and by his criminal buddies Kurt, Dave and Gale."
Antman,Antman_rm,189,"Ant-Man doesn't even try to break the mold, but at least it's less busy and bombastic than most Marvel offerings."
Antman,Antman_rm,190,"Why, oh why, must these movies telling the story of the beginnings of a superhero do the same things over and over and over again?"
Antman,Antman_rm,191,"Rudd's charm and an overall sense of silliness make for breezy summer fun. It's also Marvel's most kid-friendly movie yet."
Antman,Antman_rm,192,"Pretending there's a more fascinating version of this film out there somewhere, like the Richard Donner cut of Superman II, is a great way to come to terms with how rote and unremarkable Ant-Man is."
Antman,Antman_rm,193,This is the most straight-forward and fun Marvel movie for ages.
Antman,Antman_rm,194,"It's a film that always feels this close to being unique, and funny, and thrilling. Which is why when it misses its mark, over and over and over again, the sound of its failure resounds that much louder."
Antman,Antman_rm,195,"Fast, fun-packed (but never frivolous) and riotously, raucously enjoyable."
Antman,Antman_rm,196,"Rudd is ideal for Ant-Man's aw-shucks, I'm not into this hero business playfulness. He gleefully riffs on it."
Antman,Antman_rm,197,"A film that will surely be popular, given Marvel's marketing might, but one that's woefully short on coherence and originality."
Antman,Antman_rm,198,"This acceptably diverting superhero outing keeps threatening to break free and become something special, but in the end, there's just too much at stake. And that's a shame, especially for Paul Rudd fans."
Antman,Antman_rm,199,"When one of his pet ants is killed, Scott (Rudd) threatens the villain with a wee fist: ""You're going to regret this!"" This movie about shrinkage has a nice sense of proportion."
Antman,Antman_rm,200,"It doesn't rise to the screwball audacity of ""Guardians of the Galaxy."" Or ""Antz."" Or ""A Bug's Life."" But it's an endearing exercise in style - a playful, small-scale crowd-pleaser that parodies its bombastic Marvel precursors."
Antman,Antman_rm,201,"Yes, Ant-Man awkwardly vacillates between broad comedy and earnest adventure, and Pena's cartoony sidekick seems to belong in some other less serious movie. But Ant-Man works. In spots, it works well."
Antman,Antman_rm,202,"Everyone involved can proudly declare, ""Honey, I shrunk the Marvel Cinematic Universe."""
Antman,Antman_rm,203,"This new feature takes issues of absurdity and scale to heart in many ways; it is modest as well as ambitious, and its title character is played by Paul Rudd, the most appealingly self-deprecating of actors."
Antman,Antman_rm,204,"Ant-Man is a salvage job but a good one. In common with Guardians of the Galaxy, it exhibits a B-movie nuttiness not permitted in the studio's flagship films: your Iron Man, your Avengers."
Antman,Antman_rm,205,"'Ant-Man"" isn't your typical Marvel bombast. Instead of a sensory assault, it's more content with taking a quiet-and-quaint approach to introducing one of the stable's lesser-known superheroes."
Antman,Antman_rm,206,"As with all of Marvel Studios' movies, the action, humour and innate silliness is tempered with something a little more thoughtful and meditative, making for a highly entertaining mix."
Antman,Antman_rm,207,"It is lighter and less pyrotechnic, more friendly and entertaining than other Marvel products. [full review in Spanish]"
Antman,Antman_rm,208,A very fun epic story. [full review in Spanish]
Antman,Antman_rm,209,"""Ant-Man"" becomes the first Marvel movie to deliver a third act that's better than the first two."
Antman,Antman_rm,210,"Ant-Man is a neat package, that comfortably wears its connection to the Marvel Cinematic Universe without labouring the point."
Antman,Antman_rm,211,"Despite a story that sometimes strains under cliches, several supporting characters shine and the action-humor combinations will leave you smiling always and laughing often."
Antman,Antman_rm,212,We start with carefree exhilaration. ... But - wages of bingemanship - we then proceed to boorish silliness and finally stupor.
Antman,Antman_rm,213,"Thankfully never takes itself too seriously and isn't interested in bashing characters through buildings and streets like an out of control video game. (Full Content Review - Violence, Sexual Content, Profanity, etc. - for Parents also available)"
Antman,Antman_rm,214,"Director Peyton Reed tries to piece it together but there's just no way to make the scenes with Rudd seem like anything more than a rejected Saturday Night Live skit."
Antman,Antman_rm,215,"Ant-Man is infectious, silly entertainment, a popcorn flick that knows what it is and does what it does to an intoxicating degree."
Antman,Antman_rm,216,"The second half of this nearly two-hour film is a pure delight - fast-paced and funny and filled with special effects and humor as great as any recent Marvel movie, with the possible exception of ""Guardians of the Galaxy."""
Antman,Antman_rm,217,Colorful and creative. One of the better Marvel movies. Paul Rudd is perfectly cast.
Antman,Antman_rm,218,"There are some clever and nicely conceived sequences, and some bursts of wit - though given the writing firepower involved, there should really have been more wit."
Antman,Antman_rm,219,"...it's understandable why Edgar Wright might have wanted to keep it insulated... - that Reed manages to make it feel that way most of the time even when it isn't is a deft feat indeed."
Antman,Antman_rm,220,"Just another run-of-the-mill Marvel origin story that surprises with bursts of flair and humor, as if remnants from Wright and Cornish's script managed to fight their way into the final cut."
Antman,Antman_rm,221,"It's ""The Incredible Shrinking Man"" via ""Them"" crossed with ""Toy Story"" set in a super hero world."
Antman,Antman_rm,222,"Marvel hasn't made a movie this fun - this bright, this charming, this joyful -- since the first Iron Man, in which Robert Downey Jr.'s entitled smirk was its most lethal weapon."
Antman,Antman_rm,223,"Not only one of the more entertainingly human fantasies to come out of the studio, but it also defies the bedrock fanboy aesthetic that you don't want to merely watch the superhero-you want to be the superhero."
Antman,Antman_rm,224,Yawn.
Antman,Antman_rm,225,"The movie's almost self-deprecatory sense of tongue-in-cheek humility is matched by the fact that all the pleasures it affords are very small indeed."
Antman,Antman_rm,226,"An enjoyable, intermittently inspired effects-driven comedy and a welcome antidote to the over-burdened world-saving that seems to define big-screen superhero stories."
Antman,Antman_rm,227,"A movie that feels like it came off an assembly line, which makes it that much stranger when it keeps attempting comedy. Aw, look, the widget has jokes!"
Antman,Antman_rm,228,"Although Ant-Man is superficially shackled to the necessities of the MCU, it's snappier, lighter, and sharper than Marvel's more overblown films of late."
Antman,Antman_rm,229,"For the comic book geeks, this is manna from cinematic heaven. As for the rest of us, this a lesser but fun effort."
Antman,Antman_rm,230,"Glides us over trouble spots in tone and pacing. The little bastard from Marvel's second-tier gets the job done."
Antman,Antman_rm,231,"Like ""Guardians of the Galaxy,"" last year's off-brand Marvel hit, ""Ant-Man"" dabbles in the bright, playful colors of the superhero spectrum, reveling in moments of cartoonish whimsy and smirky humor."
Antman,Antman_rm,232,"When your most memorable character turns out to be Thomas the Tank Engine, featured in two hilarious scenes, you know your picture about a tiny superhero has big, big problems."
Antman,Antman_rm,233,"""Ant-man"" is proof that pretty good things come in small packages."
Antman,Antman_rm,234,"Rudd acquits himself well in his superhero debut, and the finished product is Marvel on Training Wheels, an introduction into the superhero universe for the youngest moviegoers ..."
Antman,Antman_rm,235,"To find a smarter bug-man saga, you'd have to go back to ""The Metamorphosis."""
Antman,Antman_rm,236,"It chugs along happily enough, but never kicks into the higher gear you keep waiting (and hoping) for."
Antman,Antman_rm,237,"One of the summer's most entertaining... one of only a handful of comic-book movies to transcend the limits of that increasingly cookie-cutter genre."
Antman,Antman_rm,238,"With its small-scale action and tongue-in-cheek irreverence, Ant-Man is a welcome relief from the large-scale destruction and save-the-universe shenanigans of recent superhero movies."
Antman,Antman_rm,239,"A looser, funnier and lower-stakes story than Marvel's typical world-ending spectacles."
Antman,Antman_rm,240,"Certainly someone with more action experience could do justice to the character's flexibility and sense of honor. In Reed's hands, ""Ant-Man"" feels about as small as its main character."
Antman,Antman_rm,241,"'Ant-Man starts weak, but finishes strong. What starts as a drizzle becomes a hurricane of action and special effects as 'Ant-Man' kicks into high gear during its second half."
Antman,Antman_rm,242,"Ant-Man isn't so much watching, as living through Weekend At Bernie's. Peyton Reed and co. come and parade the soulless and lifeless corpse of an Edgar Wright film."
Antman,Antman_rm,243,"Ant-Man cares more about setting up the future than addressing the present, and for that, Paul Rudd's best efforts as the wise-cracking insect companion are overshadowed by what's to come."
Antman,Antman_rm,244,"Poking fun at itself while still treating it's subject matter with respect is no easy task, but the stars handle it magnificently. ""Ant-Man"" is one of the most unexpectedly fun rides you can have in the MCU...or anywhere else for that matter."
Antman,Antman_rm,245,"The tie-ins with the MCU are abundant but we never feel like ""Ant-Man"" is leaning on it's big brothers too much; as a stand-alone movie this is the very reason I go to the theater at all: great action, big laughs and entertaining as hell."
Antman,Antman_rm,246,"If you can hang in there an hour and a half, this latest Marvel installment does, finally, deliver. But why do we have to wait so long?"
Antman,Antman_rm,247,"From the bongo-heavy heist music, to the deft sight gags, to little details like the scratches Scott Lang leaves while he's tiny, there's no shortage of great stuff to see and enjoy - no magnifying glass required."
Antman,Antman_rm,248,"Ant-Man fits neatly into the overall Marvel formula, even though it follows the beats of a traditional heist movie."
Antman,Antman_rm,249,"As it dutifully marches toward its special-effects-driven conclusion, Ant-Man has enough charm to be engaging if not particularly memorable once the end credits roll"
Antman,Antman_rm,250,"When it's on its game, Ant-Man does some of the best stuff ever in a Marvel movie."
Antman,Antman_rm,251,"You can't have a good Ant-Man movie without a good Ant-Man, and in the genial and charming everyman Paul Rudd, the filmmakers have done it right."
Antman,Antman_rm,252,"Funnier than Trainwreck and far better-told than Avengers: Age of Ultron, as most movies are."
Antman,Antman_rm,253,"The best thing about ""Ant-Man"" is that, for much of its running time, it doesn't seem like a Marvel Comics superhero movie. The worst thing about it is that it eventually does."
Antman,Antman_rm,254,"It's delightful and almost miraculous the way this movie manages to work as a comic heist picture on a huge scale, and with a comic science-fiction picture blended into it...while managing to cohere to the whole, you know, Marvel thing."
Antman,Antman_rm,255,The finale is something else - a symphony of comedy and action mayhem that outclasses every single second that comes before it. Nothing else in the movie even comes close.
Antman,Antman_rm,256,"Ant-Man is an entertaining blend of a superhero origin story and a caper film, the funniest and most grounded Marvel movie to date."
Antman,Antman_rm,257,"With its playful use of scale, Ant-Man drops a dollop of Lewis Carroll whimsy on the usual clashes of good and evil."
Antman,Antman_rm,258,A funny and fast-paced superhero film that serves as a welcome breath of fresh air compared to the typical end-of-the-world summer blockbusters.
Antman,Antman_rm,259,"If more of these would include nods to the Wallace and Gromit short 'The Wrong Trousers' then a future of endless Marvels wouldn't seem so grim."
Antman,Antman_rm,260,"Ant-Man emerges only as a minor hero - fine for occasional gags and cameos in upcoming Marvel ensembles, but undeserving of all this attention. And his movie feels, not like a well-deserved launch, but a contractual obligation ..."
Antman,Antman_rm,261,"Ant-Man is, well, OK, and maybe that's enough. I wanted more, and those moments where it looked like I was going to get it, only to have things not quite come to fruition, makes the film as frustrating as it is enjoyable."
Antman,Antman_rm,262,"This is the sorbet. Imperfect and perhaps creatively-compromised, Ant-Man nonetheless reinvigorated me, and, for the first time in a while, made me ready for more. No small feat."
Antman,Antman_rm,263,"Like all great heroes, Ant-Man arrives in the nick of time ... for an entire genre."
Antman,Antman_rm,264,"Powered by Rudd's goofy, good-guy sentimentality, Ant-Man filled me with something that's become a rather rare commodity in superhero movies: joy."
Antman,Antman_rm,265,"Never thought I'd type this about a comic book movie, but Ant-Man needs to take itself more seriously."
Antman,Antman_rm,266,"Half-assed mentions of the Avengers, as well as a few cameo appearances sprinkled both within the feature and in its credits stingers, exude less shame than a crowd-pandering politico."
Antman,Antman_rm,267,"Comic book movies are getting pretty deep into the B-list. So whatever its B-movie charms, this one never feels like it can play with the big boys."
Antman,Antman_rm,268,"Funny, charming and very family friendly, Ant-Man is a solid debut for what will almost certainly develop into a meatier and more assured trilogy."
Antman,Antman_rm,269,"Ant-Man has a suitably small-scale story for its tiny hero, which was a breath of fresh air when compared to the other more bloated entries in the MCU."
Antman,Antman_rm,270,"The plot's the same old thing. Mad, mad, mad, mad science; imminent apocalypse; parent/child issues; blah blah blaggidy blah. The tone of Ant-Man, however, is relatively light and predominantly comic."
Antman,Antman_rm,271,"Refreshingly simple and loads of fun, Ant-Man maximizes on its point of difference of its smallest super-hero by coating it with lots of laughter and a likeable vibe"
Antman,Antman_rm,272,"It has a big heart, it's a lot of fun, and that vibrancy is infectious."
Antman,Antman_rm,273,The narrative is leaden and lumpy in a way that suggests prolonged script-tinkering.
Antman,Antman_rm,274,A charming and eccentric heist film with a great sense of humour.
Antman,Antman_rm,275,"Marvel's tiniest hero stars in the Marvel Cinematic Universe's smallest movie so far, one that loses Paul Rudd's charm among familiar comic-book action."
Antman,Antman_rm,276,"The comedy is muted, the action scenes are slick but forgettable and the character's USP is largely wasted."
Antman,Antman_rm,277,"It's a heist movie. That's all it is, a fun heist movie with powers and explosions and awesome costumes and ant armies. It's also extremely well directed."
Antman,Antman_rm,278,"In the end, it may be more comedy than grand superhero epic, but Marvel and Disney should still be laughing all the way to the bank."
Antman,Antman_rm,279,"It is refreshing to encounter an action-adventure with a Lilliputian lightness of touch. The downside, though, is that Ant-Man seems very insubstantial fare by comparison with Iron Man, Captain America et al."
Antman,Antman_rm,280,"Ant-Man is the first Marvel film - and the first of this summer's pixels-go-kablooey time-wasters - to get better as it goes."
Antman,Antman_rm,281,"Brisk humour, keenly felt dramatic stakes, and invention over scale. You know: small pleasures."
Antman,Antman_rm,282,"One of the few Marvel superheroes you'd happily take down the pub."
Antman,Antman_rm,283,"[Snapping] from big to small to big to small, special effects transform Rudd into a micro-Bruce Lee. He appears to be having a blast. I know I was."
Antman,Antman_rm,284,"The Ant-Man movie is nonstop exposition up until the third act, so about 90 minutes. What fan of anything would want a whole movie explaining how it works? You want to see it in action, not spend the whole movie trying to convince nonbelievers."
Antman,Antman_rm,285,"Extremely likable, with a few moments of proper wonder."
Antman,Antman_rm,286,"Reed might lack the pop-art pizzazz and unruly ambition Wright might have provided (yes, that's a lot of ""mights""...), but he nails the comedy/drama/action balance and slam-dunks the set-pieces."
Antman,Antman_rm,287,"Reed and Rudd's film is proof that no matter how silly some ideas sound at first, good things often do come in small packages."
Antman,Antman_rm,288,"Even with such a weird concept about a guy who can shrink and then communicate with ants ... there's way too much that feels familiar here."
Antman,Antman_rm,289,Clunky and strange but refreshingly simple.
Antman,Antman_rm,290,As generic as comic-book movies come.
Antman,Antman_rm,291,"You can see, especially in that final, hilarious mle scene, where Ant-Man could have gone right. (Where it could have gone Wright?) But the film is too timid to fully take the wilder turns, to become its own distinct creature."
Antman,Antman_rm,292,"Watching it is like channel-surfing between Hot Fuzz, a duff early 90s Michael Douglas drama and the very schlockiest bits of Interstellar."
Antman,Antman_rm,293,"Ant-Man works within the framework of the larger Marvel Cinematic Universe, but also delivers a streamlined, fast-paced, lively and -- frankly -- utterly charming story."
Antman,Antman_rm,294,"Even the jokes that do work leave some laughs on the table, and the impulse to play things safe proves emblematic of a film that shrinks in the face of a challenge."
Antman,Antman_rm,295,"Serves up jokes that don't land and thrills that don't thrill."
Antman,Antman_rm,296,"Not only working as an out and out comedy, Ant-Man proves its originality by being the first heist movie included in the Marvel franchise."
Antman,Antman_rm,297,It all adds up to a film that is just so much brilliant funtimes.
Antman,Antman_rm,298,"Marvel's ""Ocean's Eleven"" meets ""Iron Man"" mlange does have its fleeting pleasures, but is ultimately a minor, milder MCU effort."
Antman,Antman_rm,299,"There's no sensitivity, no eye for movement, no feeling for the way a camera can create emotion out of nothing, no heart beating beneath its celluloid skin."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,0,"If the previous film was a bubbly champagne cocktail of a superhero movie, its sequel is something flatter and more concussive-akin to a series of vodka shots. Bottom line though, as long Paul Rudd is invited, it's still a party."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,1,"The screenwriters (Rudd among them) frequently mock their own sci-fi jargon, their snarkiness the strong suit in a movie offering little else except souped-up car chases."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,2,"A light and sunny entry in the ongoing Marvel canon that gets by on the cast's easygoing chemistry."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,3,A joy to watch on the big screen.
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,4,"There's a fresh sense of looseness, lots of play and pockets of weird humor... That's the stuff that makes the movie really sing - not sting."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,5,"But for the most part, the two hours you'll spend running around with Marvel's Ant pals is fun and doesn't have the same emotional investment Infinity War or even Black Panther did earlier this year. And, for once in the MCU, that's kind of refreshing."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,6,Small but mighty
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,7,"Leads have good chemistry, decent comedy, but nothing extraordinary new to offer."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,8,"It is a weird way for a film to fall between two stools: its comedic aspects are its best asset, yet overall the film seems unwilling to fully commit to that direction."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,9,"Ant-Man and The Wasp is a fun little movie that is much more focused on the lives of its characters than world-ending events, and it's better for it."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,10,"Even when following a guideline that serves a big purpose, this sequel manages to stay fresh with its quick paced script and dosed humour. [Full review in Spanish]."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,11,"Ant-Man and The Wasp brings the fun, humor, and action - and also some AMAZING girl power! The Wasp shines in her new found role, and Ant-Man is clearly the back up."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,12,"Like the original film, [Paul] Rudd's boyish charm takes Ant-Man and the Wasp further than it should go, and he's an absolute delight to watch as Marvel's most incompetent hero."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,13,"A hilarious action-packed adventure with great replay value. It's mindless enough to suck you in without making your head hurt with insipid plot lines and hilarious enough to keep you invested."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,14,"When it counts, the action fairly zings along, yet it is the little things - appropriately enough - that set the movie's tone."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,15,"The CGI impresses. However, the characters supersede the special effects."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,16,"Ant-Man and the Wasp lands the occasional knee-slapping banter and has a playful energy, but it doesn't leave a lasting sting. Evangeline Lilly is the MVP."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,17,"Ant-Man and the Wasp is a fun sequel that doesn't match the wit and originality of the first movie. [Full review in Spanish]"
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,18,"DC's Wonder Woman has proved audiences are definitely hungry for superhero films with female protagonists, so while the Wasp is an enjoyable step in the right direction, this reviewer is more than ready for more."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,19,"This feels like the movie Oceans 8 should've been."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,20,"It's a decent superhero movie with some fun moments."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,21,More ingenious than its predecessor. [Full review in Spanish]
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,22,"There is nothing ground breaking about what Marvel is doing here, but there is so much fun to be had with these people and this world that nothing was going to shrink the smile on my face."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,23,"[Ant-Man and the Wasp] is funny and sweet, a more grounded story that serves as a welcome respite from the upward-spiraling stakes we've been getting."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,24,It absolutely blows the previous Ant-Man film out of the water. The film is also full of heart too which makes this a pretty decent film to watch with the whole family.
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,25,Bottom line: The film was funny.
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,26,"The first big failure of Marvel's Phase 3"
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,27,"A fun story, but it felt like an episode of a TV series that, while you liked it, you won't really remember it amongst all the other really great episodes that came before it."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,28,"The success of his first superhero movie has allowed director Peyton Reed to loosen the reins, and the results are much sure-footed and humorous this time around."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,29,Minor Marvel is still a step above other blockbusters
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,30,"Lighthearted and humorous, Ant-Man and the Wasp is surprisingly refreshing."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,31,"Ant-Man and the Wasp is a load of Marvel goodness, with enjoyably spirited characters, exuberant action scenes, characterization improvements and a fun comedic edge that is sure to be an antidote to high-stakes drama of Avengers: Infinity War."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,32,"Of course, Rudd shows he is worthy of a title role as well, not only as Ant-Man but also as Scott Lang."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,33,"Make no mistake Ant-Man and the Wasp is better than its predecessor. It's more unique, better paced, and funnier than the previous Ant-Man film."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,34,"It is a wonderful film with great action and a terrific dive into the Quantum Realm. If the first movie was your cup of tea, then you will love this one."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,35,"Si la única razón de la existencia de esta secuela es para que Marvel pueda jactarse de tener otra heroína en sus filas, fácilmente esperábamos Capitana Marvel y así nos ahorrábamos dos de las horas más banales que el MCU nos ha ofrecido hasta ahora."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,36,"Like its pint-sized superhero, the film doesn't quite fit in with the typical MCU big screen canon and is a laid back yet thoroughly forgettable entry into the fatigued superhero genre."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,37,"Ant-Man And The Wasp is simply a fun summer family film, but does not reach the heights or standard that Marvel has built over Phase 3."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,38,"In comparison to other MCU films, the story is lacking, to be quite honest, but the cast's energy and rapport together kept me enjoying every minute of it all throughout."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,39,"These flourishes keep Ant-Man and the Wasp light on its feet...and it doubles down on the first film's fathers-and-daughters themes to moderately heart-warming effect."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,40,"Unlike some of the bigger Marvel movies, this one succeeds by going small (pardon the pun) and focusing on one unique family."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,41,"This won't become anybody's favourite Marvel movie, but at this point in their timeline, a gentle character comedy is exactly the movie we need from them."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,42,"Marvel Studios provides yet another captivating film, but its lasting impact will be far less than pretty much every other entry into the MCU."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,43,"An engaging superhero film that will genuinely appeal to both adults and children. Not knuckle-whiteningly exciting, but the humour perfectly undercuts the typical blockbuster dialogue whenever it threatens to fall into sentimentality or cod-physics."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,44,"In essence, Ant-Man and the Wasp is a rich man's Thor: The Dark World, a film that serves as much an episodic purpose as a cinematic one if not more so."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,45,One of the most enjoyable movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe with both of the titular characters holding their own in every aspect of the film.
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,46,Incredibly entertaining and exactly the antidote for a series of movies that were growing overstuffed beyond the point of exhaustion.
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,47,This could well be the least extended-preview-for-the-next-one MCU installment since Iron Man 3.
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,48,"A well-needed break from genocide-clicking titans, this breezy sequel is adequately entertaining, but vastly forgettable."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,49,"Stop turning these movies into homework, they're supposed to be fun - sit through the credits, you'll get your answers."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,50,"Three years ago, I proclaimed the first Ant-Man, ""the perfect chaser to cleanse the palette from the last superhero jam while getting us queued for the next one."" That description is applicable in its entirety to this sequel as well."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,51,"It's a welcome change of pace that reminds us that superhero films can be easy, breezy fun instead of heavy-handed spectacle."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,52,"""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" is fantastically enjoyable and one of the most brisk entries in the MCU, even if it doesn't seem all that important to the bigger picture."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,53,"Strong action and strong jokes. With nothing to top the stakes of Infinity War, it was the perfect end cap for the MCU's 2018 roster."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,54,"It's not better than or funnier than ""Thor: Ragnarok. But it has some great laughs and Lang's relationship with his daughter may be the most meaningful father-daughter relationship in the MCU outside Hank and Hope Van Dyne."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,55,"These heroes may be tiny, but the fun is big - real big."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,56,"One of the biggest victories of Ant-Man and the Wasp is that, like Civil War before it, it lets Rudd be Rudd."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,57,"Ant-Man and the Wasp zips along at a delightful pace thanks to a script full of zingers and self-awareness and Peyton Reed's keen eye behind the camera."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,58,"Full of action, fun, humour, colour and Michael Douglas, if you simply want a good old superhero flick, you won't be disappointed here."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,59,"One of the finest, most distinctive Marvel productions yet gets an expectedly sterling home-video release."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,60,"Ant-Man and the Wasp feeds into a longstanding trope about disability and doesn't even seem to realize it's doing it."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,61,"As was the case with 2015's Ant-Man, it's nice to see a Marvel movie with a self-contained plotline."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,62,A fun romp with likeable characters. It is a breath of fresh air within the larger continuity of the MCU.
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,63,"Now that the dust has settled, Marvel is back with a lighter, lesser sequel in the form of Ant-Man and the Wasp, a change of pace that's too busy to be breezy."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,64,"It deftly revels in its own ridiculousness, never shying away from how outrageous its narrative ultimately is."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,65,"With Ant-Man and the Wasp, Peyton Reed gives us a sequel that delivers everything you would want from a follow-up to the original, including plenty of exciting action sequences, stunning visual effects, and a marvelous cast to bring it all to life."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,66,"[Evangeline Lilly's] Wasp is the ... provider of the film's backbone and the answer to why part two surpasses the first - if only by half an ant."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,67,Provides a good dose of refreshing fun
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,68,Ant-Man and the Wasp is an explosion of creativity and charisma.
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,69,"This film is much funnier than most MCU films, and like 'Guardians' has unexpected heart. Rudd rocks it as a comedic actor this time around, with Peyton utilizing his talents"
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,70,"Chicanos love Moz. Also: Practical fashion for Hope van Dyne might foreshadow fewer high heels for female heroes in future MCU films. Not holding breath, but fingers crossed!"
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,71,"With a touch of romance and the promise of more sequels, the film is a superhero treat for ordinary mortals."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,72,"""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" is beige; but (in the words of Australian comic Billy Birmingham as beloved cricket commentator Richie Benaud), it's also cream, bone, off-white and perhaps ivory."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,73,"Great fun, a great cast overall...the best thing that Ant-Man and the Wasp delivers is fun. This is just antics, fun gags, all sorts of sides and shenanigans. The best stuff is bite-sized entertainment."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,74,"The right kind of light hearted action-adventure needed during a year of ultra-serious Marvel superhero fare, although the lack of a truly memorable villain dilutes the stakes somewhat."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,75,The special effects in this movie are fantastic...It just looks dope...seamless.
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,76,"As the 20th film in the MCU, ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" finds itself somewhere in the middle. But in a series with very few misses, that's a pretty good place to land."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,77,"I'm all for it...both heroes are pure fun."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,78,I still liked the first Ant-Man better.
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,79,This is a high priced sitcom.
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,80,"It's comforting to know these chapters can still resonate while embracing their role as throwaways. [This filler is] self-aware enough to unapologetically do its thing."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,81,In terms of large pieces of plot or character reveals...not a lot happened in this movie that was shatteringly significant for the future of the MCU--until the post-credit scene.
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,82,"This movie is more moments, performances, characters, and specific jokes than it is looking at the [film in] total...but it's entertaining."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,83,"A charming, fun and entertaining ride all along the way."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,84,"The comedy worked very well for the film, but I can't help the feeling that some of those comedic scenes went a little long."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,85,"It's more than happy to deliver a fun-filled movie evening, one that's both light-hearted and light-weight."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,86,"In ""short,"" it's a pretty good time!"
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,87,"It's a movie that's meant to entertain, and does, but just cannot rise above being enjoyable in the moment."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,88,"Ant-Man and The Wasp is full of color and energy, goofball personalities and obsessed geniuses, lost loves and giant insects. It uses small ideas for big payoffs."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,89,"It's featherweight fun that won't change your life, but that's perfectly OK."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,90,"Offers little (no pun intended) to the entire large scope of the MCU, but as a self-contained fun summer blockbuster that only cares to have fun and for audiences to have a good time, it delivers."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,91,"Marvel's sequel, 'Ant-Man and The Wasp,' is just as much fun as the first film and includes some even faster paced action"
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,92,"Two generations of Ant-Men and Wasps fight alongside one another and learn what it means to be family, and it is never less than utterly delightful."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,93,"Who would have thought all it took for this critic to unabashedly like an MCU movie again was a big heart and Paul Rudd's hairy chest? This Marvel hater liked it, so give it a go."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,94,"[It's] light, fluffy and jiggly at times, it's sweet enough, but without a lot of real substance."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,95,"Peyton Reed and the creatives behind Ant-Man dropped their latest installment of the MCU comedy as a cinematic reminder to take a breath. Everything is going to be okay, kids."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,96,A Fun MCU Movie With Family At Its Core
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,97,"Ant-Man and the Wasp isn't the worst Marvel movie ever, but it might be the most inconsequential... Eventually, repetition in action and tone neuter the film's creative energy."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,98,"Ant-Man and the Wasp is surreal fun. It moves swift but you're laughing the whole time, largely because of the character Scott Lang (Paul Rudd)."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,99,"You can feel the strain, a bit, for laughs in the first 15 minutes but once you settle into the movie's goofy warmth, and relatively chill vibe (well, as chill as superhero movies get that is), it's quite a fun adventure."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,100,This is just filling - something to hold over hungry movie-goers - until the next Avengers movie drops next year.
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,101,"The best thing about this movie is, I want to say, Evangeline Lily."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,102,Its intent is limited to amusing and diverting for a couple of hours of high-summer fun. That it does.
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,103,Paul Rudd is always the affable hero and this film makes great use of tropes that have become stale elsewhere in the MCU.
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,104,"It's the rare Marvel movie you wish had a little more action."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,105,"This a film that's difficult to actively dislike - Rudd and his equally charming co-stars take care of that - and fun in the moment, but there's precious little that lingers after the credits roll."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,106,"An old-school, primary-coloured charm is detectable - there isn't really a big arch-nemesis, for example - and most welcome."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,107,"There's a lot to be said for a superhero film in which the entire world isn't at stake, and where everyone isn't worrying about a skyscraper falling on their heads."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,108,"The lighter, throat-clearing Marvel episodes are a great deal more digestible than the over-stuffed showstoppers. Ant-Man and The Wasp is not the equal of the hilarious Thor Ragnarok, but it never climbs too far up its own quantum realm."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,109,"Just when things start getting boring, Rudd is on hand to reassure us, and the film's ending is a great deal of fun."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,110,"Rudd - who claims a screenwriting credit too - is likeable, funny and plays it with just the right amount of tongue in cheek not to undo all his good work."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,111,"Ant-Man & The Wasp, the studio's first release post-Thanos clicking those fingers, is a breezy, heart-warming romp that plants its tongue firmly in its cheek."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,112,"It's perfectly enjoyably fare from the Marvel roster that doesn't do a whole lot to stand out but looks good doing its own thing."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,113,"'Ant-Man and the Wasp' offer laughs, adventure, and a stinger at the end."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,114,"Once again Marvel have served up a film with all the edges blunted, where even a little passionate smooching is rendered ridiculous and sexless."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,115,"It may not be as significant to the Marvel canon as, say, Black Panther but the skittish wit and playfulness wins us over."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,116,A mild improvement over its lackluster predecessor...
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,117,"It is silly, but after the far more dramatic Avengers: Infinity War, it's a welcome light relief."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,118,"Paul Rudd's ability to keep ex-con/single-dad/reluctant superhero Scott Lang simultaneously sceptical, confused and committed to the sci-fi chaos around him without ever going boringly square-jawed is nothing less than the purest movie-star charisma."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,119,"A decent and rollicking summer holiday movie compared to most others, but miniature in the grand scheme of Marvel."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,120,"With a less appealing actor in the title role, the Ant-Man films wouldn't be half as enjoyable."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,121,A film in which the minuscule can quickly become monumental.
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,122,"After 19 Marvel movies so far, and a growing sense of global self-importance (commercially and culturally), a throwaway superhero film is, in fact, just what we need."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,123,"The two great enemies of picnic now get co-billing in this hilarious, delightful and somehow downright lovable entertainment from the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,124,"I'm tired of saying ""the special effects are great"" when nothing else in a movie is. But, yes, it's spectacularly staged."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,125,The storyline feels a little thin and moth-eaten in parts but this sequel is plenty of fun.
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,126,"There are times in the cinema when you realise you're in complete agreement with that old Spinal Tap pearl of wisdom - the one about being jealous of yourself."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,127,"The set-pieces feel somewhat expected, thankfully there's still plenty of witty banter and inventive filmmaking touches to keep the audience entertained."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,128,"This all makes for a gleefully entertaining, down to earth, two hours."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,129,"The humour and unflappable comedic timing of its cast remains the franchise's strength, and entertaining action sequences manage to uplift an ultimately heavy-handed sequel."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,130,"After a shaky first act, it becomes the bright, buoyant action-comedy ""Ant-Man"" should have been."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,131,"Want a tightly packed bundle of fast dialogue, heady danger and speculation as to which stars are coming back for a third film? Ant-Man and the Wasp is that ticket."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,132,The willingness to go breezy and small scale is extremely welcome.
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,133,"... A wild ride, using visual effects to play with size and scale in absurd and exciting ways."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,134,"A movie that is so top-to-bottom fun that it's hard to believe the same studio put out the doomsday spectacle that is Avengers: Infinity War a mere two months ago."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,135,"With a little inventiveness and charm to spare, it succeeds by charting its own course through the MCU, and I hope there are more lighthearted, character-driven adventures in this dysfunctional family's future."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,136,"A refreshingly different and delightful spectacle that also excels as a rip-roaring, fast-paced and engaging diversion."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,137,"In another context, I might say that the film was simply on par with the original but here it serves as a good chaser to the unsatisfying INFINITY WAR cliffhanger."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,138,An entertaining summer refreshment. [Full Review in Spanish]
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,139,The chemistry between Rudd and Lily is more than worthy. [Full Review in Spanish]
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,140,"Sadly, the movie has a hard time picking a villain to stick with... That coupled with a flat ending... results in Ant-Man and the Wasp just barely making it past passable, without earning itself a spot in the ranks of summer romp."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,141,"You won't mistake Ant-Man and the Wasp for anything particularly deep or even all that ambitious, but it is certainly a fun diversion."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,142,"It's an enormously fun film, but there's no way it can match up to Marvel's recent hot streak."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,143,"While the screenplay isn't as strong as it could be, the action scenes deliver in a big way."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,144,"The chaos is very funny and the final sequence is very entertaining, but it lacks enough substance to generate any sort of dramatic connection. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,145,"Ant-Man and Wasp is a concise, light and funny film. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,146,"Michael Peña's performance is the most memorable. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,147,"A Marvel film giving off the repeated vibe that in some other space and time, Pixar might have made it."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,148,"It serves as welcome respite, but essentially Marvel has followed its most consequential movie with its least."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,149,"With a self-contained storyline and plenty of laughs, Ant-Man and The Wasp is the perfect follow-up to the chaos of Infinity War."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,150,"A light, funny action film, this is not as dark as many Marvel films. Usually, in these films, the heroes are trying to save the world. This time, the stakes are more modest. It is more of a personal journey, which is a nice change of pace."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,151,"Ant-Man and the Wasp is a family film - about nuclear families, grieving families, broken families, found families. It's about fighting for the safety of your family."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,152,"It's a funny, charming, and perfectly fine movie to make you forget about life for an hour or two. Still, for those looking for something more, this movie is not that. It's a Saturday-morning cartoon, brought to life."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,153,"Ant-Man and the Wasp is far from being among the highlights of the genre..., but the good thing is that it does not pretend [to be], because it is aware of its inconsistency within the MCU universe. [Full review in Spanish]"
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,154,"Ant-Man and the Wasp is a respite, a fast-moving, cleverly written follow-up that offers up consistent laughs, refreshingly low stakes, and plenty of sight gags."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,155,"Good summer fun, and better than the first."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,156,"The non-sequitur scenes are the movie's highlights."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,157,"White it may seem to have very little at stake - it's not the emotional powerhouse that some of the other Marvel movies are - it's a sheer joy, a breath of fresh air."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,158,"Ant-Man and the Wasp is an intelligent, funny, fast-paced Marvel movie, ideal for school-holiday viewing."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,159,"Like the last installment, this Ant-Man film does indeed deliver all of the things we look for in an MCU filler, while also staking a small place for itself."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,160,"So Ant-Man and the Wasp is worthwhile, if not a must-see, appealing less for its thundering action than for its throwaway gags."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,161,Ant-Man does not pretend to be anything other than a film where the titular hero moves on a flying ant. And that is surely appreciated. [Full review in Spanish]
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,162,"Barely an hour has passed since I saw it, and it has already been reduced to dust in my memory."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,163,"Apart from being a romance, Ant-Man and the Wasp is also the funniest Marvel film you'll see."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,164,Ant-Man and the Wasp is a buzz-worthy blockbuster.
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,165,The Ant-man sequel is a thrilling fun ride that engages you emotionally and amuses you with its CGI antics and comic demeanour.
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,166,"It's enjoyable enough, even for those who would rather eat broken glass than sit through another elephantine CGI-fest from the damned Marvel Comics Universe."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,167,"Ant-Man and the Wasp blends the superhero film with comedy without feeling disjointed. More jokes landed than in most films of this combination of genres, which makes this more like a superhero comedy than a superhero film with comedic relief."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,168,"The stellar ensemble has no trouble nailing the humor while keeping suspense high and conveying some serious stakes. It's a unique and highly entertaining ride I can't wait to go on again."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,169,"Even by Mouse House standards, this is puerile stuff. Plus a waste of serious comic talent."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,170,"If this movie were a carbohydrate it'd definitely be about as complex as white bread. But admittedly, it is pretty interesting if you've ever been curious what a literal small and low stakes MCU movie looks like."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,171,"[The movie] makes us feel small and gives us the thrill of what it would feel like to be that tiny. It's a cartoon take on Gulliver's Travels - which is the delicious gimmick at the heart of the Ant-Man franchise... and impossible to resist."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,172,"Unquestionably, the recognition of The Wasp/Evangeline Lily's superhero's name in the film's title is an intelligent choice--along with the choice to center on family."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,173,"The film's larger-than-life humor and relatively low-stakes ground it in a way the MCU needed after Avengers: Infinity War with a much more personal story."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,174,"Ant-Man and the Wasp is, after all, a film about protecting and sacrificing for one's family, and it's love that binds such relationships together. And perhaps, Reed suggests, it's love that binds the rest of us as well."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,175,"If you're still rocking back and forth in the foetal position after Infinity War, here's something to cheer you up a little. Great fun."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,176,"Ant-Man and the Wasp may be light fare when compared to the other Marvel films, but just like its predecessor, it still manages to pack a pretty big punch where it counts."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,177,Ant-Man and the Wasp has another problem: the nonexistence of a charismatic antagonistic character.
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,178,"The action sequences are seamless, funny and, with their use of big-small toggles, ever surprising and fresh."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,179,"The action sequences are the most ingenious, with different uses of the suit, many of them accompanied with meta humor and some very nice gags that have to do with [the] technology's malfunction. [Full review in Spanish]"
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,180,"Therefore, in addition to being a simple plot, it is feignedly complex. [Full review in Spanish]"
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,181,"It does its job, has Paul Rudd being charming, brings The Wasp in as a full character, delivers on the action, and leaves with a mic drop of a post-credits sequence that had the audience gasping."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,182,"A light, fun side adventure that has a lot more fun with the premise and universe of Ant-Man..."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,183,"It's not the greatest movie ever made, but it achieves its mission to further the storyline within the MCU at large. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,184,"But despite its good points, not everything is honey over flakes because despite having good visual effects, the assembly feels a little lost in certain parts. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,185,A lot of humor and the entire movie is geared to a family audience. My favorite of the Marvel movies. It is MARVEL-ous!
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,186,"Big things again come in small packages, and this year's summer blockbuster message regarding the importance of family and trusting your circle of friends continues here in the most entertaining of ways."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,187,"With its convoluted screenplay as well as FX sequences of numbing repetition, it would be easy to completely write off Ant-Man and the Wasp. Yet what largely redeems it are the central characters and the performers who fill out those roles."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,188,At least one of us is way up to here with these comic book-based tales.
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,189,"As an action comedy, Ant-Man and the Wasp hits all the marks."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,190,Comic book fun and comic book shallow.
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,191,"Just two and a half months after having premiered Avengers Infinity War, Ant-Man the Wasp is the movie that Marvel Cinematic Universe needed. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,192,"Marvel Studios succeeds again and this sequel makes it clear that in the future, Ant-Man could become an even more important character in the MCU. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,193,"Where is the climax? Where is the suspense there? Where the emotion? The story that was so applauded three summers ago has lost all dimension, all its fabulous dimension. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,194,"Paul Rudd is resourceful, self-deprecating and capable of making the most of the thinnest material."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,195,Ant-Man and the Wasp delivers what it promises. Maybe a little more. [Full Review in Spanish]
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,196,"Sweetly shrinking, surreal sci-fi - marking the first MCU movie feature a female superhero's name in the title..."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,197,"After the galactic annihilation of Avengers: Infinity War, Marvel lowers the stakes and amps up the fun with Ant-Man and the Wasp."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,198,"Here's the surprising good news: lightning has struck twice. Everything I enjoyed about the first movie is repeated successfully. It's funny, imaginative, full of action-not violent action-and knockout visual effects that serve the story"
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,199,"Cheerfully (and fittingly) small in scale, with personal stakes rather than fate-of-the-world stuff and a director who doesn't pretend it's anything more than that."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,200,Ant-Man and the Wasp is one fun ride which never loses its steam.
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,201,"It's all disposable and inconsequential fun, and enough to tide audiences over for the next power-packed, supersized extravaganza."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,202,"This is a breezy, fast-paced sequel that goes out of its way to provoke buckets of laughter and massive sighs of wide-eyed awe."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,203,Mostly improves upon everything the original film did.
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,204,What is there not to like about watching a bad guy get knocked off of his speeding motorcycle by a giant Pez dispenser bouncing down the road?
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,205,Barely fresh. Some fun bits. A half hour too long for what it is. Superhero fatigue setting in.
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,206,"Marvel's latest is a delightful stand-alone film that'll also leave fans with an unfamiliar feeling: uncertainty."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,207,"The way Ant-Man and the Wasp change their sizes to surprise bad guys or accomplish some kind of task puts a smile on your face at the same time that it's generating excitement."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,208,"Lily emerges from the shadows and becomes a true half of a perfect whole, and she and Rudd play beautifully off of each other, executing terrific timing both physically and comedically."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,209,"""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" is another great example of what comic book movies should be: a good time."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,210,"But, like Ant-Man, who gets woozy when he stretches too tall, the movie gets into trouble whenever it tries to go big."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,211,"In a summer of indistinguishable franchise entries, this is one not to swat away."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,212,"Unlike the unaccountably dull ""Ant-Man"" feature that came and went three years ago, this one tangles us up cheerfully, almost instantly, in its high-tech bedazzlements and witty beguilements, never loosening its grip."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,213,"Ant-Man and the Wasp is fun on a bite-sized scale, and it is everything that it wants to be."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,214,"And while the fights and stunts are occasionally eye-catching, those eyes often end up wandering off as the combination of fast editing and quick-growing-and-shrinking props makes it hard to follow the action."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,215,"The [film] does not detract from the original, although it is obvious that the humor has been amplified for the sequel. [Full review in Spanish]"
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,216,A passably entertaining film with no answers to its biggest questions.
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,217,"Ant-Man and the Wasp is an eager puppy of a $100 million superhero tentpole, and it knows precisely where on your face to lick you."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,218,"An enjoyable bit of escapist entertainment that should appease both critics and regular moviegoers alike. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Profanity, etc. - also Available)"
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,219,Would be okay and maybe even fun were it not for the frequent presence of a gruesome ghost haunting the proceedings: a woman in constant physical and emotional agony who is trying desperately not to die. A weirdly disturbing fly in the amiable ointment.
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,220,"Director Peyton Reed has a light touch, which works well with Rudd's patented off-kilter comedic delivery."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,221,A welcome respite from the endless gush of showier Marvel super-product.
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,222,"The movie is akin to the last days of school after finals, when everyone is goofing around and having fun."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,223,"Paul Rudd is neither an aunt nor a WASP but he's fantastic in ""Ant-Man and the Wasp."""
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,224,Perfectly disposable pop culture.
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,225,"Like its 2015 predecessor (which also followed on the heels of a gargantuan ""Avengers"" movie), this is a funnier, gentler, and, appropriately enough, smaller Marvel movie."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,226,"This ""Ant-Man"" entry stakes out its own corner of the Marvel Universe sandbox as a throwback to '80s-style childlike adventure."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,227,"Aside from a few flourishes of aesthetic inventiveness and a single moment of genuine wonder, ""Ant-Man and The Wasp"" doesn't do very much with its premise."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,228,"It's worth noting that while Ant-Man's listed first, this sequel is really all about the sting of the Wasp."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,229,Ant-Man & The Wasp is funny and fun but a little too wrapped up and tripped up by its quantum entanglement of plots to be truly great.
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,230,Breezy Ant-Man and the Wasp great fun.
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,231,"In a cinematic world crowded with comic-book flicks, ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" stands out. And that's no small accomplishment."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,232,Underwhelming
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,233,"Even so, the sharpness in the dialogue, the sympathy Paul Rudd always exudes, and, again, his sensible perception of being a minor product, make Ant-man and the Wasp a more acceptable ephemeral pleasure. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,234,"Rudd's easy charm and sly comic energy make a billion-dollar property feel like a slacker comedy made by some friends in their loft, with everyone in the cast getting at least one good moment."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,235,"Even when things get ultra-corny, Ant-Man and the Wasp keeps merrily buzzing along."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,236,"It's as throwaway and silly as it sounds, and a welcome relief from the sombre air of other recent Marvel Cinematic Universe movies."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,237,"[Ant-Man] gets by on his propensity for knockabout humour, his child-like enthusiasms and the company he keeps. He's likeable, his films are kid-friendly, and that's about it."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,238,"Mildly entertaining, breezy and funny despite its overstuffed, convoluted and unremarkable plot and lengthy running time."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,239,"[I]ts plot and its comedy feel like separate entities vying for control, while the characters vie for movie's focus and heart."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,240,"Half the living beings in the universe aren't at stake, just two lives. If you're ok with that after Infinity War, then this is the perfect superhero summer blockbuster palate cleanser."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,241,Director Peyton Reed reassembles almost everyone from the original film and returns to build on the surprising magic that the unlikely team managed to pull off the first time around.
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,242,"It is a nice change to have a light, breezy Marvel flick that's more like a heist than a save-the-world superhero film."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,243,"It's nice to see a Marvel movie that seems intended to amuse us more than it's designed to beat us into submission."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,244,We already know that superhero movies have to be loved as they are. [Full review in Spanish]
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,245,"The most enjoyable aspects of the movie are the special effects as people, cars, buildings - and even a Hello Kitty Pez dispenser - shrink or grow in size, as the plot dictates."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,246,"The tight-knit ensemble delivers a fun, small-scale caper that's delightfully self-contained."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,247,"Ant-Man and the Wasp follows through on that stuff and goes even further with scale-shifting action sequences. More importantly, this film uses Rudd exponentially better, giving him plenty of opportunities to be goofy and charming and Paul Rudd-y."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,248,"It's a refreshingly loose and daffy approach to the genre that Marvel seem to have a lock on."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,249,"Ant-Man and the Wasp proves to be a fun romp, but not one that's completely compelling to blockbuster fans at the level of the ""Avengers"" movies."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,250,"All in all, Ant-Man and the Wasp amounts to a tidy, tight and consistently entertaining package. Unwrap without any reservations and simply enjoy."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,251,"If it weren't for a smattering of PG-13 language, Ant-Man and the Wasp would be the perfect superheroes to save the whole family from the summer heat for a couple of hours."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,252,"In a world where superhero are everywhere, you have to play up the thing that makes your superhero movie unique. The Ant-Man movies play that unique quality up well."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,253,"Ant-Man's new adventure is entertaining and far more ambitious on a visual level and extremely fun. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,254,"Retaining all of the humor and charm of 2015's 'Ant-Man', this marvelously delightful and energetic sequel never takes itself too seriously."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,255,"Unquestionably the most light-hearted franchise from the House of Marvel, that quality is in full swing in this consistently laugh-out-loud funny sci-fi adventure."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,256,"While not a franchise game-changer, there's something soothing about the lower stakes of this sequel's well-honed heist plot, making it a fun follow-up."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,257,"Thankfully, Paul Rudd as Ant-Man is as engaging as ever. He almost single-handedly saves this sequel, which is genial enough but not nearly as much fun as the original."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,258,The film cuts superheroes and their oh-so-serious issues down to size.
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,259,"There is cuteness and chuckle-worthy visual and verbal jokes, but the film-maker weaves in that element that eludes others: heartfelt emotion."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,260,"Rudd remains the heart and soul by stepping back and letting everyone else fill the room. He's one of the great modern straight men, but when he lets rip... it's a quick-witted back-and-forth that's easily as funny as a drumming ant."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,261,"No matter your size or your grasp of science or superheroes, Ant-Man and the Wasp is pure quantum fun."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,262,"""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" is disposable pop trash, not worth taking seriously for a moment and therefore eminently worthy of your attention at this moment."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,263,A high-spirited lark of blessedly little consequence.
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,264,"Plodding, repetitive, replete with technobabble nonsense and lifeless action, this is easily the worst-written of any of the 20 MCU offerings and may be the worst all-around film featuring a Marvel superhero since Sony rebooted Spider-Man."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,265,"Though Rudd and Peña work like mad to get laughs, they come up well short of optimal levels achieved in Thor: Ragnarok."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,266,"It keeps things small-scale and low-key, and for the most part turns out better for it."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,267,"...the most fun you're likely to have at the movies this summer."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,268,"A hugely enjoyable action offering that happily comes as one of the better efforts from Marvel's infamously erratic output."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,269,"In general, the actors and their delivery of smart dialogue - on top of some excellent action sequences - are the main reasons to watch the film."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,270,"It's honestly a little hard to separate Ant-Man and the Wasp's actual quality from what a lovely break it is from reality."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,271,"Director Peyton Reed and his writers (including Rudd) have a lot of fun with scale, sizing the vehicles up and down and Scott himself getting as big as the Statue of Liberty."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,272,...a light movie that favours humour and family drama over action and destruction.... [Full review in Spanish]
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,273,"[F]ast-paced, laugh-out-loud funny, and packed full of one-size-fits-all blockbuster entertainment sure to excite fans young and old. But what it has more than anything else is heart and soul..."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,274,Director/co-writer Peyton Reed has basically made a large-scale summer comedy that just so happens to star superheroes.
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,275,"An engaging goof that resists bludgeoning you with bigness and instead settles for good vibes and jokes. Look! Up in the sky! It's a bird! It's a plane! [Squints.] It's a surprisingly enjoyable summer romp!"
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,276,"Though in every respect a lightweight addition to the Marvel canon, the innocuous 'Ant-Man and the Wasp' is mildly enjoyable."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,277,The writing is patchy throughout and the dialogue is dreck.
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,278,"The strength in Ant-Man And The Wasp is that it's a small-stakes, personal superhero caper that's unconcerned with the bigger battle for the world's soul. It's such a relief to not be asked to invest in something grandiose."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,279,Over the two-hour run time it never gets dull to see objects shrink or grow in visually impressive perspective shifts and absurdly comic moments...
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,280,"In the diminutive figure's second effort, average things come in small packages."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,281,"Actually, the events of Ant-Man and the Wasp don't tie into Avengers: Infinity War, and this creates a weird respite, reminding audiences of the entertainment derived from past Marvel features like Thor: Ragnarok and Spider-Man: Homecoming."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,282,"[""Ant-Man and The Wasp""] is pretty much exactly what I'd want in a superhero movie: a funny cast, zippy action scenes and not an infinity stone in sight."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,283,"Ant-Man and the Wasp is a classic Marvel superhero film but also a fresh palette cleanse to the MCU we've known for so long."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,284,"Light and breezy, it's a worthwhile superhero sequel."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,285,Ant-Man and the Wasp is a fun-sized flick.
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,286,"Here's how professor-level particle physics filters down to the general public: via ""Ant-Man."" Much more fun this way. Definitely worth the price of a movie ticket."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,287,"[Peyton Reed] keeps it all breezy, light and laced with humor."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,288,"As the saying goes, good things come in small packages."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,289,"Ant-Man and the Wasp runs nearly two hours, but its merry mix of deft one-liners, visual gags, restrained action sequences and subatomic protoplasmic spectacle never drags, especially with Rudd's witty, confident performance."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,290,"I'm not ashamed to say that I most enjoyed ""Ant-Man"" when it felt like a sequel in spirit to ""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids."" ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" doubles down on that vibe and then some."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,291,"If Ant-Man and the Wasp is hard to love, it's also hard to actively dislike."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,292,"It's like the movie-going equivalent of a beach read."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,293,"Ant-Man and the Wasp is entertaining from beginning to end, especially after the apocalyptic ""Infinity War."" [Full review in Spanish]"
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,294,"A welcomed change of stakes and tone, coming from Infinity War. Lighthearted, fast and funny, Ant-Man and the Wasp is a solid sequel to the original. [Full review in Spanish]"
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,295,"Ant-Man and the Wasp is a hilariously, fun action-flick that takes the edge off the tragic ending of Avengers: Infinity War."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,296,"Funny, action-packed sequel is lighter Marvel fare."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,297,"The adventure is swallowed up by exhausting attempts at humor that don't land nearly often enough."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,298,"A good time at the movies... If the first film felt more carefully laid out, the sequel succeeds in stoking some Pixar-style emotion in its family dynamics..."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,299,"This terminally boring, by-the-numbers installment is credited to five screenwriters and all they've come up with is an inverse game of hot potato with the usual assembly of players (the good guys, the bad guys, the law and a wild card)."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,300,"It's fun, it's funny, and it's got such lower stakes than Avengers: Infinity War that it's practically the equivalent of a relaxing Sunday afternoon in the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,301,"We'll get back to the fight against Thanos soon enough. Enthusiasts can resume arguing over various aspects of Marvel minutiae then. For now, ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" is a nice break."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,302,"There's a lot going on here, which leads to a whole lot of gassy exposition to explain it all, including two separate scenes in which two different groups of good guys are tied to chairs while villains bloviate on the intricacies of the plot."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,303,"Turns out there is a plot device more annoying than time travel - quantum. But the make-it-up-as-we-go-along story aside, Reed still has a flair for using toys at his disposal - glitchy shrinking/growing devices, sight gags, Scott's giant ant pals, etc."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,304,"The funniest part of Ant-Man and the Wasp is the fact Marvel followed their despairing Avengers: Infinity War cliffhanger with a disposable side-adventure. Are they having a laugh? Yes, and loving it."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,305,Its quiet optimism feels both welcome and badly needed.
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,306,Ant-Man and the Wasp is all in pursuit of some MCU masterplan. If only the journey there was a bit more of a buzz.
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,307,"Paul Rudd gets plenty of big (and small) laughs in Ant-Man And The Wasp, a Marvel outing thankfully on the light side, with a breakthru female character co-headlining a Marvel film for the first time."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,308,"Bursting with dynamic special effects, skillful action, and a gentle human element that never gets displaced."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,309,"Funny, enticing, a Marvel treasure, I loved it!"
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,310,Truly Marvel. [Full Review in Spanish]
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,311,"A light, watered-down tonic leading up to next May's Avengers 4 extravaganza."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,312,"The earlier film's freewheeling, low-key loopiness is replaced by a dull and dutiful plot that, with its forced references to other Marvel installments, squeezes the action to fit the franchise."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,313,"What came naturally, and perhaps accidentally, the first time out feels practiced and artificial here. The rhythm is, slightly but persistently, off."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,314,Ant-Man and the Wasp is so breezy and charming that what would be defects in a more self-serious film are assets here.
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,315,"I found this movie totally engaging. Rudd is absolutely charming and, as we've seen before, very funny."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,316,"ANT-MAN AND THE WASP is solid family fun, and if you missed the first installment from 2015, it doesn't matter --- you will still enjoy the sequel. Having said that, however, the movie is a bit too long at a shade under two hours."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,317,"There are few, if any, surprises delivered through the course of ""Ant-Man and the Wasp."" In fact, I was bored more than once and found myself checking the time - frequently."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,318,"Ant-Man and the Wasp may not be the best anything, but, like its perpetually challenged hero, it is plenty good enough."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,319,This focus on family and extended family gives Ant-Man and The Wasp a little more heart than most superhero films.
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,320,"If any word sums up Ant-Man and The Wasp it's the one you never want to hear about a sequel: Extraneous."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,321,"As much as the jokes are funny and mostly work, it starts to get in the way of the drama, or at least the emotional heft, that they're trying to go for with what is ultimately this rescue story."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,322,There is more of an emotional underpinning to this one than there was in the first one because of the Michelle Pfeiffer element to it.
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,323,"Big laughs, small concerns."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,324,Adequate to sate the audience between the major tentpoles.
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,325,"""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" is merry and fleet, and no less enjoyable for being instantly forgettable. The buzz might be temporary, but it's fun while it lasts."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,326,"Showcasing Marvel's funny, family-friendly side, ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" is just fine. And given the heavy narrative that played out in ""Infinity War,"" it's a tiny reprieve from all the death and destruction."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,327,"It's a movie that understands all the variances of scale, and takes the audience along for the ride as they constantly change."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,328,"This is a wonderful toy that one imagines young girls in particular would like - and it's hard to believe that there will be anything funnier this summer."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,329,"It's a dazzling, fast-paced, outrageously funny superhero romp that feels more cohesive than its 2015 predecessor, Ant-Man..."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,330,"It comes close to greatness but stops a little short. And that's not a big deal."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,331,Instantly forgettable and habitually unfunny.
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,332,"Scruffy, understated and fun, the sequel sidesteps just about all of the gravitas left hanging after the events of April's highly-anticipated superhero crossover."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,333,"Ant-Man and the Wasp is a nice lighthearted breather from recent devastating MCU events; this isn't the first time Ant-Man has had a tough act to follow, and judging from this sequel, it won't be the last, as the successful levity is welcome"
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,334,Ant-Man and the Wasp is undoubtedly a laugh-out-loud blockbuster superhero movie that will entertain audiences and provide a much-needed break to all the drama happening elsewhere in the Marvel Universe after Avengers: Infinity War.
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,335,"Not everything has to be serious and epic, sometimes having fun is just what we need."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,336,"Ant-Man and the Wasp is delightful from start to finish, especially after the apocalyptic Infinity War."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,337,"A sequel... is automatically more interesting because it is building off the history of another movie. This proves true with Ant-Man and The Wasp, but not because it's the sequel to Ant-Man, rather because it's the sequel to Captain America: Civil War."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,338,"Occasionally agreeable but ultimately disposable, [it's] a bauble that feels less like a fun side journey and more like a waste of everybody's time."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,339,"The movie takes nothing, including itself, seriously, and just runs on as a nice caper with relatively low stakes and goofball humor."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,340,"The payoffs aren't plot points but the gags, which somehow defuse the tension without turning the picture into camp."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,341,"""Ant-Man and the Wasp,"" the first sequel to 2015's ""Ant-Man,"" is barely an exoskeleton next to its much better predecessor."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,342,"Ant-Man and the Wasp brings humor and levity back to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It's loaded with incredible action scenes, really amping up the visual effects from the first film."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,343,"Inconsequential, but damn, is it fun."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,344,"No sting here: this one's a big, happy hit."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,345,"Almost as enjoyable as the first. Not quite the same impact, but a good ride from start to finish."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,346,"I loved the action, I loved a lot of the humor, but it wasn't as good as the first one in my opinion..."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,347,Ant-Man and the Wasp works well enough.
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,348,"What the film does best, though, is entertain us with a kinetic romp through the Marvel Cinematic Universe without being held down by it."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,349,"Ant-Man & The Wasp is a triumph not because it sees its heroes saving us all from oblivion, but because they desire the same comfort their audience does when they're possibly doomed to the void: a gentle embrace from those closest to them."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,350,"Delivers giant sized laughs, fun thrills and is all together a perfectly timed chapter of Phase 3 to loosen the mood up for MCU fans."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,351,"A blast of pure popcorn fun, and something of a palate cleanser after the weightier likes of Black Panther and Infinity War."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,352,"It's disjointed, and cluttered, but it's also entertaining in spurts. Is that enough? Just about, and not quite."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,353,This is one of those Marvel products peddling self-aware detachment as a defining narrative strategy...It feels less like a feature film than a meme somebody made about an Ant-Man trailer.
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,354,"The basic necessities of narrative momentum are given the requisite focus and care that in better properties can produce exceptional Marvel entertainments... but in the case of Ant-Man, words like ""basic"" and ""requisite"" are always the ceiling."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,355,While Ant-Man and The Wasp is a bit lighter than the average Marvel film... the comedy is subtle and fits in well with the storyline.
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,356,"The script is snappy, and the jokes keep coming, making Ant-Man and the Wasp a healing balm after the dark ending of May's Avengers: Infinity War."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,357,"Ant-Man And The Wasp is arguably even more of a straightforward comedy, to the point that it doesn't even have a primary villain."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,358,"Ant-Man and the Wasp is a crowd-pleaser of a film, and a reminder that great characters and fun scripts are what make enjoyable comic book movies-not just a huge shared universe."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,359,Ant-Man and the Wasp is a two-hour mental break when a lot of people could need a mental break.... I mean this as a huge compliment.
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,360,"There's no getting away from the fact that Ant-Man And The Wasp, as fun as it is, lacks the sheer, mind-blowing heft of Infinity War... In this new era of Marvel over-achievement, it really does feel like a lesser work."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,361,"Ant-Man and the Wasp is a hilarious return to the shrinking heroes, but with elevated action and a heartfelt story, it's a well-rounded Marvel sequel."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,362,"With its constant humor and the energetic chemistry between Rudd and Lilly, ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" is the most playful of the Marvel movies"
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,363,The thrill of the film is watching Ant-Man and the Wasp team up and raise hell together.
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,364,"You might wish the whole movie had found a way to go quantum; you'll certainly long for more Pfeiffer, who has too few scenes but invests each of them with her usual luminosity."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,365,"""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" has its moments, but it doesn't quite measure up to the original."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,366,Ant-Man and The Wasp brings some much-needed comedy to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,367,This is a very funny movie that I laughed out loud to more times than I can count.
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,368,"Ant-Man and The Wasp is a great breather that was sorely needed after Infinity War. It makes me appreciate Avengers more while allowing me to breath, kick up my feet, and just have fun for two hours."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,369,"Ant-Man and the Wasp is an airy, nimble piece of filmmaking: Reed's confidence to unapologetically embrace weirdness gives the franchise its distinctly playful spirit."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,370,"It's a lively, funny and unapologetically fantastical change-of-pace from the last few ""gotta save the world"" MCU epics."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,371,"Its comedy is wonderfully offbeat, its heart is huge and emblazoned on its sleeve, and its intentions are wildly optimistic and bright."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,372,"Improving on the lackluster 2015 original, ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" is winningly modest, no small feat for a film which is part of the gargantuan Marvel Cinematic Universe."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,373,"Ant-Man and the Wasp never forgets that it's a part of one of the comedic pillars of the MCU, and it keeps the jokes flying fast and free."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,374,"Rudd is such a friendly, likable presence; he sets this movie's pace, while Lilly's fiercely committed Hope/Wasp acts as the perfect counterweight. Rudd's scenes with Lilly and with Fortson make the movie matter in human terms."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,375,"Ant-Man And The Wasp surpasses the original by miles, functioning best when it embraces its sheer absurdity and loopy lunacy."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,376,It seems pretty nice. Would that we could wrestle the rest of the world down to that same agreeable scale.
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,377,"While Ant-Man's technically ""the star,"" this is most definitely the Wasp's movie to own, and the smirking, enjoyably no-nonsense role fits Lilly well."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,378,"Isn't the funniest Marvel movie ever made, or the deepest or the coolest or the most creative. But it just might be the nicest, and that counts for something."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,379,"The essence of ""Ant-Man"" is inherently silly, and that's where the strength of the new movie lies."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,380,The rest of the Marvel family could learn a thing or two from the scrappy small-scale of their tiniest colleague.
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,381,Ant-Man and the Wasp is a comparatively modest film that puts a premium on fun.
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,382,Ant-Man and the Wasp is the funniest movie Marvel has made yet.
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,383,"The good news is, Ant-Man and the Wasp is better than the first film."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,384,"After a rough start in the previous entry, director Peyton Reed seems much more comfortable balancing wacky antics, familial bonds and over-the-top superhero set pieces this time around."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,385,"Ant-Man and The Wasp is bolder, funnier, and far more daring than the film that preceded it, but also slightly less even and narratively tight."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,386,"Ant-Man and The Wasp isn't an essential Marvel movie, but it's further proof that good things come in small packages."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,387,This latest entry in the unstoppable Marvel Studios takeover of the world is probably the most amusing film the company has made since the Kevin Feige reign began a decade ago.
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,388,"Like the first movie, director Peyton Reed (""Bring It On"") mixes action and laughs to deliver one of the most enjoyable moviegoing experiences you'll have this summer."
Antmanthewasp,Antmanthewasp_rm,389,"Ant-Man and the Wasp has a pleasingly breakneck, now-you-see-it-now-you-don't surreal glee. It's a cunningly swift and delightful comedy of scale."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,0,"Through it all, Jason Momoa... tosses off coyly bluff one-liners with understated humor that goes to waste in this bloated and sludgy movie."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,1,"Veteran cinematographer Don Burgess's widescreen images beguile, and Bill Brzeski's production design impresses mightily, but next time, someone please give Momoa and company some memorable dialogue."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,2,A thoroughly entertaining ride.
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,3,"But oh, those action sequences: this is what the Tron sequel should have looked and sounded like."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,4,"Had this movie arrived as recently as two years ago, it might have been heralded as a higher-end superhero movie. Things have changed, however, in both the DCEU and the MCU."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,5,"The bright spots (Momoa, that octopus) can be difficult to really relish amid the oceans of exposition and a typically pulverizing, overelaborate screenplay."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,6,"This film is everything, but most of all it's a deliberate confection. It's instinctively and immediately silly."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,7,"The action sequences are just so gleefully bonkers that one can't help but get swept up in it."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,8,"If you're willing to surrender to what [James] Wan has created in the depths of his CGI ocean then you're potentially in for a delirious ride of entertaining lunacy."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,9,"Aquaman was a film that could have been great, but fell flat. The amazing CGI did not make up for the cheesey jokes and what felt like a dumbed down script."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,10,Splash meets Game of Thrones in this thoroughly entertaining slice of submersible superheroics.
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,11,Another lump of coal in the DC Extended Universe stocking. Unnecessarily loud and horribly written.
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,12,"After wallowing in darkness for far too long, DC embraces some relatively lighter fun in its latest superhero adventure, Aquaman."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,13,"Once in a while, Momoa lets out a gut laugh or barbaric yawp that cements him as that rare thing, a king you want to have a beer with. A king and a fool -- a Falstaff with a six-pack."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,14,"Aquaman is not a flawlessly constructed film but takes the DCEU in a welcome direction, enthralling with stunning visuals and grounding itself in humanity."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,15,"Somehow, James Wan manages to pull it off, creating a film that not only refuses to apologize for adhering to its roots, but fully embraces the inherent absurdity that comes from trying to bring these characters to life in a realistic setting."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,16,Aquaman is forgettable and average.
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,17,"Hardcore fans of Peter David's take on the character may enjoy this movie... for the rest of the world, James Wan's adaptation is cringy and barely watchable. [Full review in Spanish]"
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,18,"As many similarities it has with other properties, Aquaman has this infectious confidence that makes it difficult not to like."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,19,"The film's simple-mindedness makes it work."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,20,...could have used more octopus percussionists.
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,21,"While ""Aquaman"" does manage to have a little more going on when it comes to its narrative and characters than most other entries in the DCEU, it still suffers from numerous other problems, including a repetitive structure and an uninspired climax."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,22,"Nothing about this movie works. It is way too obvious, it's got cheesy special effects, it feels like a 1980's film with the jokes, and it's trying too hard."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,23,"The best way to define it is like ""the Schrödinger movie"": a film that is at the same time between the best and the worst. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,24,"One of DC's first genuinely fun and entertaining films. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,25,"This film knows exactly what kind of film it is, right down to Wan showing off Momoa's on-screen smolder by playing a snippet of rockin' metal whenever he enters the scene."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,26,"One indeed comes away from Aquaman interested in what further aquatic adventures may yet be in store, with or without any of his Justice League teammates by his side."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,27,"Aquaman does nothing to subvert or expand its genre, but as superhero movies go, this is one of those that's worth watching for the sheer pleasure of it."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,28,Aquaman is a success. The film makes the most out of its fine cast and psychedelic imagery and remembers to have some fun along with the world building.
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,29,"Aquaman shows that someone at DC finally learned the most important lesson of superhero films: no one wants to spend over two hours in a theater with a bunch of characters they wouldn't go to get beers with."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,30,"With Aquaman, the character, being one of the rare highlights of Justice League, it's reassuring to see Aquaman, the movie, build upon the half-human, half-Atlantean's momentum."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,31,"DC have doubled down after the muted reaction to Justice League and thrown everything at the wall, and most of it sticks."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,32,"Throughout, Aquaman maintains a level of eye-popping visuals and crazy spectacle that always keeps things interesting."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,33,"It's a straightforward and pretty undemanding plot, stretched unnecessarily over two hours and 23 minutes, and the only depth the film has is the ocean."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,34,"Not only sets the DC Films universe back on course, but it also introduces a new bona fide movie star in Jason Mamoa."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,35,"Aquaman is a goofy, fun time if you don't think too hard."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,36,"Aquaman is an ambitious film but one that isn't afraid of being campy while being committed as an action-packed underwater adventure."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,37,Quite possibly the worst comic book movie ever made...
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,38,"Like much of the movie, it doesn't really make sense but you just go with the flow and enjoy the ride."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,39,"Plot-wise, the result is a hot, foamy mess, my friends, but a mess that washed over me like a tidal wave."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,40,"There are a lot of structural problems in this movie, some things that are a little too long...but it's also a very fun movie to watch, and it exceeded all of my expectations."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,41,"It's definitely worth the watch, and I do think that the best way to experience this movie would be on the biggest screen possible. I don't think that 3D would be necessary either."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,42,"It's a hoot."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,43,"It's a fun movie, a little long, but the pacing of the action is actually pretty good..."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,44,"Action, romance and adventure: It's all here in 'Aquaman.'"
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,45,"Aquaman has to rely on its visual wonder, as the script is rather rough-shod with some of the worst dialogue I can remember from these capes and tights exercises"
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,46,"It's certainly more entertaining and competent than most of the previous DCEU films but that makes its silly missteps and bloated plot all the more frustrating."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,47,"Aquaman may be the movie Arthur Curry's alter-ego deserves, an epic spectacle of ludicrous joy that's as dreadfully terrible as it is thrilling."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,48,"It's not the greatest superhero film, but it's not the worst, and everything it has to offer has been done better."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,49,"If Aquaman breezes past philosophical dilemmas to get right to the mayhem, at least Wan and company commit to said mayhem 100 percent."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,50,"Its infrequent shots of fun aren't worth the headache."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,51,Too much going on; too little of it matters.
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,52,"With the game cast, a charismatic lead performance by Jason Mamoa, the electrifying visuals and the infectiously fun tone, Aquaman is a cinematic wave you will want to catch."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,53,"It's a step in the right direction [for Warner Bros. and the DC Extended Universe.] There's just a few kinks to be worked out before the inevitable sequel."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,54,[Jason Momoa] makes the movie really fun to watch.
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,55,"I like Aquaman. I'm not saying it's a great movie or that it's the savior of the DC cinematic universe, but it is a lot of fun."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,56,"All in all it's not great, but it's not terrible. Better than Thor 2, I will say that, but I feel like this is one of those movies I'll forget the plot of."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,57,Aquaman appears to have everything except rhythm or a clear vision. [Full Review in Spanish]
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,58,"With big battles and complex lore, it clearly wants to be an underwater Lord of the Rings, but instead ends up closer to Phantom Menace territory, with some tonally incoherent splashes of Fast and Furious."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,59,"Hollywood has given us the greatest, goofiest holiday gift in a long time."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,60,"a serviceable entry that is worth dipping one's toes back into the DC cinematic waters"
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,61,"Overall, it's not top-notch quality, but a goofy film with a goofy protagonist, a visually stunning world and fun action sequences."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,62,"Aquaman's faults are very marked, but its virtues are impressive and manages to create an entertaining experience. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,63,"There were some cringe-worthy acting moments in this movie...that's due to the script more so than the actors themselves."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,64,"Cheesy and ridiculous, but also a surprising amount of fun."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,65,"Kinda fun, mostly due to Momoa's charisma and presence, and the underlying sense of levity. Aquaman doesn't suck any more, but he definitely needs a better vehicle than this."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,66,A fast-paced free-for-all with fantastic special effects and a solid story about a troubled young man who finds himself the last hope for two worlds.
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,67,"...naturally overlong, overblown and sopping wet with CG effects."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,68,"Aquaman is fun. It's a lot of fun! Especially if you are willing to shut your brain off and enjoy the movie on the level it is intended."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,69,What follows is a straightforward superhero adventure - but it is all heightened by a couple of standout factors.
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,70,"Aquaman's script is plodding and lacking the emotional weight or character development it needs to draw the viewer in"
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,71,"After the sombre slogs of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and Justice League, it's refreshing to see a hero that doesn't take himself so seriously."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,72,"Momoa, Kidman, Wilson and others are there to service the script, even when it gets cheesy, and it does get cheesy indeed, but the film's warmheartedness and clarity of purpose win out in the end."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,73,"Aquaman is dumb and loud and really dumb and too long and dumb but also wonderfully creative and shameless; it's both the superhero film we need, and the one we deserve."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,74,"Momoa was terrific in the role, and even though it's peculiar that the DCEU is doing things in reverse, we've finally arrived at his time to shine in a solo film."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,75,"Aquaman actually breaks the dour DC mold and delivers a gonzo, highly inventive piece of entertainment that has a surprisingly fresh vision overseen by director James Wan."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,76,"Aquaman, as directed by James Wan and reconceived by Warners executives chasing after Marvel's jackpot, is all about copycat desperation -- and shrillness."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,77,"A fish-folk tale making a spectacle of itself... mindless and muddled with glimmers of grandeur. In truth, Aquaman's appeal is strictly tied to Momoa's enthusiasm: it's infectiously sexy."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,78,This action movie has a fair amount of humor in it. Jason Momoa seems to embody the right combination of imposing physique and jovial good nature to pull this off.
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,79,"Aquaman is far too long, constantly undercutting its charm in service to derivative action sequences that lose all appeal by the third act."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,80,A film that luxuriates in all of the absolute dumbest nonsense of superhero comics.
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,81,"Jason Momoa is perfectly cast as the DC action hero but the movie is not as good as he is. Too long, too many repetitive fight scenes, and just a general dragginess to the whole thing."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,82,"When Dolph Lundgren riding a giant seahorse is the least crazy thing in a movie, you know it's taking you to some outrageous places."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,83,Aquaman is filled with incredible sequences. [Full Review in Spanish]
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,84,The special-effects (especially in the all-important underwater environment) never quite pack the wow-factor expected from a massive $225 million production.
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,85,"[James] Wan definitely took the opportunity to lean into the campiness and Momoa's innate sense of humor, and that's not necessarily a bad thing."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,86,"Momoa is a hugely talented comic actor, and he brings a playfulness and enthusiasm to this film which keeps it bubbling along despite - or even as a response to - the tiredness and predictability of the plotting."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,87,Aquaman offers two and a quarter hours of pure and simple escape. [Full review in Spanish]
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,88,The director knows what he has in hand and makes the most of it. [Full review in Spanish]
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,89,"Two and a half hours literally submerged in a giant fish tank where, except for common sense, everything floats. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,90,But the real star of Aquaman is its director. [Full review in Spanish]
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,91,"I do not have a single reason to recommend Aquaman or its Atlantic or oceanic din, despite its good intentions to denounce the seas' ecological disorder [caused by] human beings. [Full review in Spanish]"
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,92,"Aquaman is rough around the edges but nevertheless an enjoyably silly ride that unabashedly embraces the cheesiness and weirdness of its world and runs -- er, swims -- with it at full speed."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,93,"Offers something that suddenly seems revolutionary -- a superhero movie for... comic book fans. Nearly every exaggerated, Day-Glo frame feels like it was pulled from a hand-drawn panel."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,94,"While  Wonder Woman  reveled in the intimacy of Themyscira,  Aquaman  and director James Wan paints the largest picture possible."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,95,"It's campy and miles over the top, but fun in its loopy wouldn't-it-be-cool-to-breathe-under-water way."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,96,"See it on the big screen for a fun, beautiful, underwater ride. Just don't expect too much in terms of story and acting."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,97,"Aquaman is super fun when it embraces its silliness-there's an octopus that plays the drums! There's an army of cranky crab-men!-but by the end, it just feels bloated and squishy."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,98,"It may not be coherent, but as far as messes go, Aquaman is certainly one of Hollywood's more watchable ones."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,99,"Entertainment value limited to humor and big visual mastery, ""Aquaman"" does mark forward progress for the DC universe."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,100,"As the equivalent of a Jason Momoa pinup calendar, Aquaman rates four stars. As a superhero film, this soggy enterprise merits decidedly less."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,101,"A superhero origin story with an aquatic Avatar, Star Wars war and Indiana Jones treasure-hunt adventure rolled into one. It makes a seaworthy splash amidst all the superhero fares. A swimmingly rollicking, action-packed fantasy adventure."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,102,"The fix is easy: Mo Momoa, Fewer Problems."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,103,"A movie where budding romance, rising palace intrigue, and swash-buckling adventure take a back seat to the quiet glee of watching a team of gifted visual effects artists recreate the aesthetic of a Lisa Frank trapper keeper on a giant IMAX screen."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,104,"With charismatic leads and some sublime visuals that overpower the ridiculous, Aquaman is DC's second good movie and first real statement piece since 2013."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,105,"Aquaman is an underwater spectacle that wholeheartedly embraces its comic book roots, from the costumes to the cheesiness."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,106,"Any excitement audiences expected from director James Wan, who has helped reinvigorate the horror genre with The Conjuring series, will wonder if perhaps his success is limited to blood baths and jump scares."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,107,"If there was one film to sum up the hit-and-mostly-miss nature of the DCEU, it's Aquaman."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,108,"Exciting, visually stunning underwater lore..."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,109,One of the most wildly imaginative and purely fun blockbusters of the year.
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,110,"If the series is going to fully recover from Zack Snyder's early assault, it will have to better marry brains with brawn, resisting the false choice of Wan's salty blow out."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,111,"It's such a mess not even a fine performance by Jason Momoa as the shirtless and trident wielding good-ol'-superhero can rescue it from the bottom of the sea."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,112,"Through it all Momoa's muscle ripple as the camera objectifies his beauty in a way that is usually restricted to women."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,113,"Take one cliché from every comic book movie of the past decade, put them in a blender, then throw that blender into the ocean. Boom. You've got yourself an Aquaman movie."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,114,"Hunky, self-deprecating Jason Momoa is more of an Aqua Dude buoyed by a riotous deluge of dazzling visuals that refresh the DC universe."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,115,"We have another movie about a biracial hero coming to terms with his place in the world, a superhero film that enthusiastically embraces its more ludicrous tropes, and a sprawling epic that makes the movies of the DCEU worth watching again."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,116,"Aquaman dares to be its own beast. And with a charismatic hero at its center to bridge the divide, DC remembers playfulness can actually be a boon."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,117,"Aquaman is goofy and messy and sprawling, hyperactive and jokey ... but it isn't bleak. It is unabashedly itself, and by not taking itself so seriously, it allows room for some actual fun."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,118,"Ultimately, like much of the DCEU, Aquaman just can't make things work. While there's a definite sense of humor behind the film, it doesn't take things far enough."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,119,"Director James Wan is not concerned with shoehorning his film into the greater DCEU, which gives him the freedom to make a film that rolls Aquaman's origin story and an exciting plot into a movie that surpasses most of the studio's other efforts."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,120,"Sorry Charlie, 'Aquaman' is a blast."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,121,"Aquaman is so unapologetically over-the-top, its madness is undeniably entertaining."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,122,"Generating some modest thrills with minimal genuine suspense, the film dives deep visually while emotionally remaining on the surface."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,123,"A refreshing, fast-moving, visually inventive adventure that actually has some heart at the heart of all the epic battle scenes...though Aquaman honours superhero movie conventions it largely avoids that stale formulaic feel we're often forced to endure."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,124,"One just has to throw up one's fins and give in to the ridiculousness."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,125,"Aquaman breaks the mould. It's an authentically light-hearted brand of rubbish, taking a tongue-in-cheek delight in its own absurdity."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,126,"Aquaman gives Warner Bros. another base hit for the DCEU, but it might have been better served by making it a Mera-centric film with Aquaman as a supporting player."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,127,"It's wildly uneven, tonally all over the map, and clogs the screen with special effects that range from pretty great to pretty bad. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Profanity, etc. - also Available)"
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,128,"In making the first DC superhero film in a long time to aspire to anything like levity, Wan finds a way to catalyze what might have been yet another dust-dry origin story."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,129,"As brain-dead fun, this movie is smarter than you think."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,130,"The world-building here is definitely the best of any non-Wonder Woman DCEU film, the action sequences are first-rate, and unlike in Zack Snyder's Superman films, there's actually sunlight."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,131,"All in all, it amounts to the most campy DC outing since Joel Schumacher helmed a couple of Batman movies in the '90s. That's not a recommendation."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,132,"There's plenty of visual invention on display, but the eye can't totally silence a question from the mind: How much underwater spectacle does an Aquaman movie need before we start to drown in it?"
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,133,"There are so many unnecessary CGI blowups cluttering the movie that Mera's chemistry with Arthur doesn't get the oxygen it needs to ignite the love affair Aquaman wants us to believe in."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,134,"Aquaman isn't all dumb fighting and arguing among sea-guys. The movie's biggest selling points are its affable, bear-hug spirit and its lavish, loopy visuals."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,135,Beautifully silly and tons of fun.
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,136,"There are parts of Aquaman that are so wonderfully strange that it's astonishing to see them in a franchise blockbuster."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,137,"It's all eye candy for the viewer. The production designers have outdone themselves."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,138,Not all comic book characters have unsolvable mommy issues and sometimes embracing the cheese is a relief.
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,139,"The costuming is on point and the visuals of the film are amazing. Atlantis, in particular, feels like an underwater Pandora and is a feast for the eyes. Where the wheels start falling off is continuity, scriptwriting and use of characters."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,140,"Aquaman is the king of the seas, just put your brain on pause and let the movie wash over you."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,141,"This movie is a theme park ride... while it's fun it has really no big emotional impact."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,142,"It's the world of Exposition."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,143,"This time the origin story is under the sea in a fight for dynasty, but Aquaman is unable to disembark from the kitsch weight that is characteristically DC. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,144,"There are some impressive battle sequences but a few too many moments of poor CGI, making it feel like you are watching a cartoon or someone playing a video game at times."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,145,"Even graced with the charming company of Momoa and Nicole Kidman, who is having a blast playing his high-kicking, otherworldly mother, the timing and tone of this movie is consistently off."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,146,"While its stunning visuals and underwater combat make it a vast improvement over many of the other DCEU films, an overcrowded story and campy dialogue make it far more exhausting than exciting."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,147,"The screenplay must have had the line ""suddenly, they are interrupted by an explosion"" copied and pasted randomly several times throughout."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,148,"DC Comics' oceanic superhero gets his own movie, but star Jason Momoa isn't enough of a screen presence to carry the weight."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,149,Either the best bad movie or the worst good movie of 2018.
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,150,"Momoa, while amiable, is like a handsome stuntman. He and Heard cannot carry the film. Derivative action. Creatures from menu at Red Lobster."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,151,"Because it is entertaining, ""Aquaman"" can rest comfortably as the second best film in the DCEU."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,152,"Wan's descent into comic book fantasia is close to incredible, even its frequent missteps overflowing in an infectious giddy fervor that's close to wonderful."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,153,"With the world the way it's going, it's not surprising people would rather watch a buffed guy swim with dolphins. But with so many resources spent on it, this is one underwater adventure that dries out fast."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,154,"It was only about 20 minutes into Aquaman that I heard the unmistakable sound of a movie taking on water... Titanic didn't go down this fast."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,155,Is there anything hugely wrong with Aquaman? Not really. Is this a missed opportunity? Yes.
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,156,"Aquaman works because it isn't laughing at itself-it's both joyously whimsical and confident in its own sea-worthiness."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,157,"I can recommend Aquaman as a fun couple of hours in the theatre. It isn't going to re-write cinema or anything, but I do think it keeps DC in the running for being able to produce an enjoyable movie that entertains fans and casual watchers alike."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,158,"There aren't enough drumming octopi to make this movie memorable, an observation I thought I'd never have to make."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,159,"Take a dehumidifier to ""Aquaman,"" and after all the water evaporates, what's left is a garden-variety superhero movie."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,160,"Just plain fun, and manages to establish the franchise as a solid pillar to stand alongside Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,161,"While DCEU heroes like Henry Cavill's Superman and Ben Affleck's Batman were unbearably solemn, it is easy to see that Momoa is having a blast in the lead role."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,162,"You lift, Dude Bro? Cuz this ship is sinking..."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,163,"Only Julie Andrews voicing a sea monster, a CGI octopus playing eight drums at the same time, and Roy Orbison's ""She's a Mystery to Me,"" which backs a video-like tribute to Curry's blooming love interest (Amber Heard), gurgle up anything memorable."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,164,"CGI action fans will be awestruck by the special effects which dominate Aquaman, a must-see in 3-D."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,165,"The underwater world is CGI at its most smothering-your eyes cry out for air, for tangibility. Everything is weightless and yet oppressive, like a sheet tangled around a drowning human body."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,166,"For some it might be an acquired taste, but it succeeds by pairing simplistic narrative ambitions with an authentically wild visual experience."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,167,"Sure, it's memorable, but it's far too unwieldy to be effective."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,168,"It's predictable yet fun; it's a worthy hero origin, but being that it's this good for a hero so heavily chided for so long, it feels like even more of an accomplishment."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,169,"As superhero origin stories go, it's actually an improvement over most of the movies based on DC comics."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,170,"...it's a more memorable movie than most of the lesser Marvel films, and thus, DC takes another step toward righting the ship."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,171,"Aquaman is not really a bad movie by DC's standards, but it is the weirdest thing they've made in recent years by a country mile - and not always in a good way."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,172,"The film's hyperkinetic nature makes it impossible to be less than entertained. But because Aquaman is always go, go, go, there's not much room for character development."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,173,"Halfway through the waterlogged kookiness that is Aquaman, I half expected the title character to announce that he lived in a pineapple under the sea."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,174,"It's a Saturday morning cartoon with an insane budget. The visual effects are stunning, but there are a lot of narrative and pacing issues...the movie saves itself continuously with phenomenal action sequences."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,175,"I think the movie is fun. For some reason, some people can't accept it...when can ""fun"" not be an acceptable way to describe a movie?"
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,176,"It brings across that feeling of how deep, dark and mysterious the sea is."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,177,"There was no theme, ultimately, but the music did help move the movie along..."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,178,"Even Arthur seems to know this is all 'find the maguffin and save the world' but the film can't have that much fun with it. The screenwriters have to play through the typical save the world/fulfill your destiny plot with predictable twists."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,179,"The latest movie from the DC Universe is an embarrassing shamble that is highlighted by clunky dialogue, characters who constantly shout their dialogue and hackneyed CGI special effects that look as if interns created them."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,180,"Like the title character, the movie is nice to look but does itself a disservice by speaking."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,181,"[Aquaman's] delightful silliness does point to what these movies should have been doing all along: standing alone, rather than trying to reconcile the weird worlds of its various heroes for premature team-ups."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,182,"[A]s soon as [James] Wan's able to free the beast at ... the film's midway point, Aquaman realizes its potential as a show-stopping blockbuster oddity."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,183,"While Aquaman is one of the better DC films, it is still fairly uneven. It gives us a glimpse at a whole new mythos and makes the world of Atlantis feel ancient, creating a fantasy story that offers something different for DC fans"
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,184,"When you're riding a damn shark into war and there's an octopus playing drums and also Nicole Kidman is there? I wouldn't say no."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,185,"A fantastic display of Big Trident Energy that's more than happy to attempt beating you into submission."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,186,"The wow factor is gone - it's a bubbly undersea yawn."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,187,"Aquaman mostly ignores establishing, let alone developing or evolving, its eponymous superhero in any meaningful way."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,188,A colorfully over-the-top comic book adventure that overcomes tonal stumbles and some iffy CG with pure charisma and fun.
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,189,One of the most enjoyable movies in the so-called DC Universe...its cheeky sense of humor and striking visuals make it a better-than-average example of the genre.
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,190,"None of it makes a ripple of sense, even when blown up to IMAX 3D size."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,191,"Momoa might nail the everyman end of the spectrum, with copious beer guzzling and manly hair flipping, but he doesn't invest this dude with much regal leadership potential."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,192,"Like the Star Wars prequels, like Avatar, it's a movie with tons of problems, but it also contains images that made me catch my breath - gorgeous and even numinous sights I will remember forever."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,193,"Big in every way , but fortunately not ALL wet thanks to a lively Jason Momoa and some terrific underwater visual effects."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,194,It swims more than it sinks.
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,195,"Wan has a great visual eye or, at very least, a master's degree in CGI."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,196,"James Wan's Aquaman has way too much going on. It's all three Lord of the Rings underwater, with a grand finale giant fish war that's like the largest tureen of bouillabaisse ever cooked."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,197,"A strong, effective story that makes the Aquaman character feel like a genuinely big deal... A triumph. Go and see this big 'n' loud as soon as you possibly can."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,198,It is far too silly to be taken seriously and far too plodding to work as some kind of oddball oddity. It never sinks to the depths (sorry) of a complete misfire... but it just never clicks.
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,199,"The underwater action-adventure picks the most over-the-top elements of James Wan's directorial style and mixes it with cartoonish CGI and 80s comic-book madness for a laughably bad end result."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,200,"It took a while, but the DC Extended Universe finally has embraced the inherent silliness of superheroes."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,201,"Check your brain at the door, and you should mostly enjoy its 143 minutes."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,202,"For all its wild spectacle and cartoon cleverness, this is a quietly subversive movie, and an evolutionary step forward for the genre."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,203,"[Jason] Momoa's made for this sort of over-the-top action role and if we can't have him back romancing Khaleesi and leading the Dothraki, then an Aquaman outing will just have to suffice."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,204,"Visually spectacular with an exquisite aqua colour palette, the film is an inventive and immersive underwater fantasy firmly anchored by its larger than life star, Jason Momoa."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,205,"""Aquaman"" is weird and corny and fun, but it would have been more fun if the weirdness and corniness had been dialed up to 11."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,206,"Aquaman is the increasingly rare superhero movie that's also a star vehicle, as well as being one hell of a triumph for its director."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,207,"It's as splashy, action-packed and utterly bonkers as you'd expect a story about a fishy fella who can save the world would be."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,208,"What ultimately holds it together is that this film is self-aware about its silliness, to the point that it is often sublime."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,209,"The periodic bursts of creativity and weirdness can't fully hide the fact that this superhero epic doesn't offer anything new. It's mostly fun, but could have been way better."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,210,"You're just waiting for the wild final act, when Wan fully embraces the metal promises of this Aquaman concept, and we get to witness Arthur fighting fishmonsters and Mera straddling an Orca as she rides into a psychedelic subaquatic battle."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,211,"... from beginning to end, Aquaman is big dumb fun. It doesn't dare take itself seriously, and it's a better movie for it."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,212,"It looks as if we've finally got what we've long asked for: a superhero with the looks and attitude of a forgiving bouncer in a Venice Beach heavy metal bar."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,213,"Not even an up-for-anything Jason Momoa can save Aquaman from being a joke. Still, the fun is a relief after all the recent DCEU superhero gloom. Any fish epic that finds time to show us an octopus playing bongos gets a pass in our book."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,214,"Whatever the case, Aquaman falls into an uncomfortable try-hard dead zone that leaves it in better shape than, say, Batman v. Superman or Suicide Squad, but just shy of the gleefully anarchic predecessors... like Jupiter Ascending."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,215,"At times, the plot feels like the 12 Labors of Hercules, with a couple of extra labors thrown in just for the heck of it."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,216,"The saving grace of director James Wan's great-looking and reasonably entertaining but also meandering and sometimes truly ridiculous Aquaman is that everyone from screenwriters through the talented cast seems to get the sheer, waterlogged lunacy..."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,217,"...so utterly entertaining, wickedly inventive, and insanely paced that it comes spinning into cinemas like a breath of fresh ocean air."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,218,"This movie is really entertaining -- a lot of fun! But it's also ""a lot,"" period."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,219,"Aquaman is so exquisitely tailored to and fitted around the outsized personality and impressive form of Jason Momoa that it's almost impossible to distinguish star from vehicle from character."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,220,"If Aquaman has anything going for it, it's the fact that it fully embraces just how ridiculous it is."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,221,"It's just two and a half years of - sorry, two and a half hours - of oceanic screen savers and hair that won't stop undulating so we know when we're underwater."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,222,"It seems director James Wan had one overarching goal in making ""Aquaman."" His prime directive? Crush the audience into submission."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,223,"Playing like a modern-day parody of '80s fantasy films like Clash of the Titans, Aquaman embraces the camp, the zany, and the weird."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,224,"Wan swings for the fences in crafting arguably the most ambitious comic book film we've seen on the big screen yet."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,225,"A big dumb acid-trip of a super-hero movie - relentless, noisy, entertaining nonsense, with trippy sight gags like a drum-playing octopus and a wedding dress made of jellyfish."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,226,"While Momoa is just fine as the titular ""Aquaman,"" [the] screenplay features far too little humor and far too much origin story - by the time Orm's visiting those remaining undersea realms, they feel like jammed in afterthoughts."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,227,"It's big and splashy, a visual feast with real stakes, but also with an earnestness it wears proudly on its sleeve."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,228,"Released fifteen years ago, this flick would have been a good enough romp to pass the time. Now, however, with the advent of so many incredible superhero ventures, Aquaman just feels stagnant."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,229,"Obviously, there are some negatives here. Still, AQUAMAN is a hard movie not to recommend. It is often funny, has a good heart, and its star proves incredibly endearing."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,230,"[Momoa] clearly knows he cannot take the subject matter too seriously, and there is always that wink, smirk and devil-may-care attitude that makes him rather charming."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,231,"James Wan has thrown everything he can think of on the screen, but the best special effect in this extravaganza is Jason Momoa's hair."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,232,"The film is indeed a little stronger in story and character than some of its predecessors in the DCEU have been, but it still has a long list of problems all its own to contend with."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,233,"Is it too long? Yeah, probably. Does it contradict some of the things we learned about Aquaman in the Justice League movie? Nothing important. The elements that work far outweigh the ones that don't."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,234,"A visual and audio symphony by James Wan, which takes VFX storytelling - and the DCEU - to a whole new level. This movie has to be seen to be believed!"
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,235,Another disappointing entry in the DC Comics cinematic universe.
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,236,"To use a cliche - because this movie loves them - it's just crazy enough to work."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,237,"Aquaman is a hard concept to buy into, but when this much thought and care has gone into its construction, it's easy to get caught up in the wonderment of it all without asking too many questions."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,238,Aquaman promises to bring hope to the DC universe. [Full review in Spanish]
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,239,"Royalty is merely dignified status. Heroes are revered legends. Cue the ""why not both"" gif and you've got Aquaman."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,240,"Love Momoa -- but two hours and twenty-three minutes is plenty of time to contemplate why Warners cannot manage ""the Marvel touch."""
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,241,"Momoa is a triumph in this joyously spectacular tale of myth and modernity; its hero so endearing it's easy to ignore the clunkiness of the dialogue and a villain treading water until next time. The salt water gets everywhere, I even found some in my eye."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,242,"It's good that Aquaman is so action packed and full of visual distractions that it doesn't leave you any time to reflect because once you stop to pause, the plot really sinks."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,243,"There is the occasional cool visual and clever world-building detail, like jellyfish couture and eye-popping underwater physics, but ""Aquaman"" never fully commits to its lunacy."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,244,Aquaman is a visually entertaining superhero film that is sure to entertain the masses despite its flaws.
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,245,"When it's not tediously predictable in its clichés, its complete lack of narrative or thematic daring, and its colorless meathead hero, it's a mess of incoherent action and noisy psychedelic chaos."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,246,"[Aquaman[ has seven seas' worth of the simpler kind of wonder, the razzle-dazzle imaginative kind."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,247,"At times, though, it's ludicrous even for kids' stuff, and its undersea make-believe means we face an even heavier battering from CGI than comic-book movies usually deliver."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,248,It left me weary and water-logged. Blub-blub.
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,249,A spirited pulp-adventure that should make doubters take this fishy hero seriously.
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,250,"""Aquaman"" is pure camp, wildly entertaining and an eye-popping spectacle. You have to admire the effort, scope and sheer audacity of everyone involved."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,251,"The character engagement is minimal and Wan doesn't make enough use of the charismatic Jason Momoa in the titular role, however there's a certain allure to the weird and wild places the film is willing to go on its bloated voyage."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,252,"As deeply entertaining as Aquaman proves to be, its full potential hasn't even begun to break the surface."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,253,"Superhero stories aren't just about fighting, but the examination of self. When Aquaman remembers this, it's a sight to behold."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,254,"""Aquaman the film isn't as deep as the ocean, but Aquaman the man is just as captivating."""
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,255,An overstuffed B picture which stretches its fun too thin.
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,256,"Aquaman - for the DC Universe - is better than expected. But if you understand the cinematic inconsistencies within the franchise then you know that's not a complement."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,257,"The film isn't totally unenjoyable, but it isn't particularly coherent either."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,258,"At times spectacularly stupid, at other times just plain spectacular, Aquaman is Thor by way of the Fast and the Furious franchise."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,259,"The film is a treat to behold whenever it dives into the ocean as Wan embraces the absurdity at every turn, wearing the inherent goofiness as a badge of honour."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,260,"It's neither the worst nor the best superhero film of the year, but it feels small compared to efforts like 'Infinity War' or 'Spider-verse'. [Full review in Spanish]"
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,261,"When you start worrying in a superhero universe about the mechanics of how it works, it means that something isn't clicking."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,262,"I'm not saying Aquaman is good. But it is extremely watchable, totally insane good time."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,263,"But that did not justify a film that does not go either up or down, but floats desperately in a languid ocean so shallow that floating in it is clearly useless, unnecessary, a vile waste of energy. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,264,"It's 2018, and I bought an Aquaman movie...it's Momoa or bust...the more I think about it, the more I like it."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,265,"There are a lot of things that work. The writing isn't the best, though and there are a lot of repetitive shots...just barely, it works."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,266,"Sadly, it's a crazy amalgam of subpar storytelling, non-stop action and constantly swirling camera work. Motion sickness ahoy!"
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,267,Aquaman is simply too over-stuffed and over-long.
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,268,"This is a competent enough origin story, but its oddball nature means that it's unintentionally hilarious at times."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,269,"People will be very cross that I don't ""get"" what was trying to be done, or that I didn't catch the comic references - but you know what? Get in the sea."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,270,"There is plenty here to admire and enjoy. Too much, really."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,271,"I didn't hate Aquaman, though at close to two-and-a-half hours it was beginning to outstay its welcome when the credits finally rolled."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,272,"Director James Wan (Insidious, The Conjuring, Saw) has brought a very particular vision to the project and it's undoubtedly a brazenly idiosyncratic take on a superhero movie."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,273,"Aquaman is a colorful, action-packed spectacle with a somewhat feeble plot. Jason Momoa gives our hero a sardonic smile and punishing physical presence."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,274,"The film's real heroes are the SFX wizards and the production design team. They have really surpassed themselves creating fantastic underwater realms and making them teem with even more fantastical creatures."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,275,"It's equal parts Game of Thrones and Indiana Jones; like Black Panther told from Killmonger's perspective. It isn't as polished as Wonder Woman, but neither is it as putrid as Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,276,"Not only it's surprisingly fun, but also visually ambitious. [Full review in Portuguese]"
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,277,"Whilst Aquaman is far from perfect, it still delivers an entertaining, vibrant ride and Momoa shows us what DC really stands for - Damn Cool."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,278,"Go on, dive in."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,279,"There are no answers, because none are deemed necessary."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,280,"However, beyond the exuberant visual display to give life to the civilization of Atlantis and to develop the spectacular underwater battles, [James Wan's] contribution in Aquaman is disappointing. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,281,"With ups and downs between the fantastic and the absurd, Aquaman is plainly a fish out of water. [Full Review in Spanish]"

Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,285,Underwater origin story has lots of comic book action.
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,286,"Like the story, the lines, the performances and the design, Aquaman is part camp, part kitsch, but all crap."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,287,"Mercifully the scale is reduced to a more human size for the last action sequence which allows Momoa and Wilson to show off their posing and trident skills, which are considerable. The film is sure to be a rich source of desktop backgrounds."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,288,"Aquaman, it's worth repeating, is gorgeous, the set-pieces across the various kingdoms of the underwater realm examples of artists allowed to not just hew close to the messed-up source but indulge in their own inspirations as well."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,289,"Not perfect and a little long but fun, chaotic, an full of action, humor, adventure and a carisma-filled cast that enjoys itself as much as it wants the audience to enjoy it [Full review in Spanish]"
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,290,A fascinating and admirable journey that includes almost every element of the superhero genre you can think of. - [Full review in Spanish]
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,291,"Jason Momoa shines in a lighter-hearted role, and filmmaker James Wan fully embraces the plot's increasingly ridiculous gyrations."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,292,"The DC Comics aesthetic has never been more accurately portrayed on screen, so it has that going for it. Narratively, though, it's still kind of a mess. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,293,"It avoids being sheepish about its more preposterous concepts, instead revelling in its comic book goofiness for a rollicking B movie adventure."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,294,"Bold, ambitious, visually stunning, and wonderfully unique, James Wan's Aquaman is one of the best comic book films of the year."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,295,"Aquaman is an adventure without an anchoring character or idea, and suffers from the plodding stolidness of its lead actors."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,296,"It's still style over substance a lot of the time, but that style bears a real love for the source material, and that's what should be at the heart of every superhero film. Well, that and Jason Momoa's abs."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,297,"An epic adventure that takes audiences up in the air and down to the depths, offering myth, muscle, and pure big screen scale."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,298,"It's just a fun, unchallenging adventure movie - perfect for the Christmas season."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,299,"Aquaman is a step toward restoring equilibrium, creating a sprawling undersea world that most closely resembles the Thor franchise in terms of scope, majesty and happily, humor."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,300,Aquaman is such an eyeball-scald and an eardrum-shiv it makes me long for the relative excellence of Justice League.
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,301,"Wan manages to marry Arthurian fantasy and swashbuckling adventure with camp in Aquaman, a film that feels a little like a miracle in Warner Bros.' catalogue of superhero movies"
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,302,"Jason Momoa is an excellent Aquaman and the world of Atlantis looks like something out of ""Avatar."" But there are some things that feel too cartoonish, some jokes don't quite land, and the film continues to make some mistakes of past DC entries."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,303,Director James Wan keeps things moving but seems a little out of his depth when fishing for laughs.
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,304,Aquaman is a flawed but thoroughly entertaining adventure movie and certainly one of the strongest instalments so far in the inconsistent Worlds of DC franchise.
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,305,James Wan knows how to have fun with absurd material without making fun of it.
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,306,"It had a few stumbles, but as a whole, it is an awesome action-packed adventure."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,307,"What DC's Aquaman movie lacks in refinement, it makes up for with action spectacle and a whole lot of fun personality from Momoa's Arthur Curry."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,308,"Not since ""Superman: The Movie"" have I seen a DC comic book movie wear its heart on its sleeve, unveiling every single element of the Aquaman lore with sheer unabashed excitement and enthusiasm."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,309,"[Aquaman] wasn't for me, but I admire a lot about this movie."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,310,"A superhero movie with the scope of an epic but the spirit of a mischievous boy, ""Aquaman"" is a goofy, uneven adventure that proudly sticks to its loopy vision even if it doesn't quite work."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,311,"I won't front like I didn't enjoy some elements of the film, but as a whole? It felt like I was watching a film based on what worked in a number of superhero flicks over the last few years."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,312,"Jason Momoa's surf-bro superhero is a welcome addition to a ponderous genre, but his movie as a whole is waterlogged."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,313,"It's 20,0000 leagues over the top!"
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,314,"With fun, nonstop action, Wan's stylistic direction, and strong charismatic performances (especially by Momoa), ""Aquaman"" brilliantly solidifies that the DCEU is here to stay."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,315,"[A] nonstop rollercoaster ride of heart-pounding action, eye-popping visual spectacle, and all-around crowd-pleasing blockbuster entertainment that is insanely enjoyable to watch."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,316,"Aquaman contains a one-on-one gladiator-style battle underwater and surrounded by lava. An octopus is also on the drums hyping up the fight. That's not even the craziest image in this aquatic adventure"
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,317,"Bloated and overcooked, yes those two things are possible, the film somehow succeeds in its own zany weird way. Aquaman should be seen on the biggest screen possible with the least pretentiousness given."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,318,"The real appeal of Aquaman comes down to director James Wan, who goes full bore with all the Silver Age pulp the source material has to offer."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,319,"A fun, exciting, imaginative, occasionally silly but undoubtedly epic adventure that establishes an incredibly rich new cinematic world."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,320,Aquaman works as well as it does because director James Wan gives us a story in which we find ourselves wanting to tag along for the fun.
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,321,"Like with so many movies tasked with introducing unseen worlds and great reams of brand-new mythology, Wan's contribution to the DCEU offers a busy, overpowering deluge of information even if he conjures some stunning, operatic imagery along the way."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,322,"A star turn for Momoa, who leads the ridiculousness of this anarchic, campy superhero outing with serious energy and charm. Another promising move for the DCEU."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,323,"It's certainly fun to watch, and I spent most of it giggling with glee and/or dismay at how crazy it all was. But it also feels like wasted potential."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,324,"Rich and retro, Aquaman is a higher form of adventure hokum. It is made to silence people who grew up saying, ""They don't make films like that any more."""
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,325,"James Wan has absolutely no sense of taste, but he has a grand sense of scale, which he leverages throughout the ludicrously insane, but fun, Aquaman to great effect."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,326,Swims into cinemas on a high tide of stunning CGI and waves of superhero comic book action.
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,327,"It feels like a step in the right direction for the DCEU. What's more, its hero's former 'joke character' status is kept well at bay."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,328,"Take away Momoa's steady presence, and you're looking at an overstuffed mess that provides entertainment purely in an OMG-this-is-a-disaster kind of way."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,329,"This is a let-down: a laborious, slow-moving and dripping wet film, barnacle-encrusted with solemnity and with a ripply-underwater production design that looks like a giant version of the kitschy items that you put in fish-tanks."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,330,"Notwithstanding the inevitable formulaic dialogue and a superabundance of boilerplate superhero action sequences, ""Aquaman"" turns out to be, almost despite itself, an engaging undersea extravaganza."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,331,"Wan weaves comedy, sci-fi, high fantasy, and action into something that constantly surprises. Jam-packed with brilliant action, spectacular visuals, and likable characters, Aquaman is never afraid to have fun, which makes it a bright spark in 2018."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,332,"Aquaman needs its smirking, beer-loving, roadie-looking, Chippendale-chested hero -- not to save the day, but to remind us that this is stuff is about as goofy as it gets."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,333,"Aquaman's as formulaic, excessively thrashy, and mommy-obsessed as any other entry in the DCEU, but its visual imagination is genuinely exciting and transportive, and dare I say, fun."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,334,James Wan has created something that feels fresh and new in a genre that is beginning to feel very tired and formulaic.
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,335,"There's a knowing silliness to Aquaman that helps gloss over its sometimes-shaky CG and over-complicated mythology, and a willingness to go for broke that keeps us guessing about what we'll witness next."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,336,I would watch Arthur Curry splash around throwing punches twenty times rather than return to a color-drained and depressing cityscape where the hero is sad and mad.
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,337,"Should I cheer? Should I laugh? Is everyone okay? Aquaman is one strange movie, but certainly a fun one."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,338,"Aquaman is a well blended smoothie of 1980s fare, which often works to its advantage but sometimes results in clumsy and clunky moments."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,339,"It's just H2-OK."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,340,"Despite the nagging flaw that is Aquaman's hyper-extended plot, the movie delivers in its action sequences and its bright visuals."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,341,"It might suffer from a patchwork script, a lack of sincere characterization, and tonal shifts that are more chaotic than any shark-on-whale battle, but damn if it doesn't look pretty."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,342,"Its unapologetic ridiculousness is exactly why it's so delightful, bucking so many of the rules set for the genre in the last decade."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,343,Wan has taken a seemingly impossible task and imbued it with clarity and personality.
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,344,"Watching this movie is like spending two hours and 27 minutes staring at a gigantic aquarium full of digital sea creatures and actors on wires, pretending to swim."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,345,"Often divertingly colorful and busy to a fault, Aquaman seems to dare us to mock the world of comics' most risible superhero."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,346,"[James Wan's] conjured an intriguing world, but populated that world with dramatic cotton candy and silly characters, including a hero who's unsure if he wants to make us laugh or feel - and winds up doing neither."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,347,"In a better world, ""Aquaman"" would excel at delivering an ecological message to the masses. But all the fish in the sea can't salvage a movie that refuses to go more than surface deep."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,348,"The majority of the time the action set pieces seem quite arbitrary... This saddles the overlong film with a ponderous, grinding feel, one driven by a sense of obligation more than the glee of inspiration."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,349,"For all its sporadic wackiness and wonder, on balance Aquaman still comes out a bore. But they've given it a heroic shake."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,350,"Welcome to Aquaman, where you won't have a clue what's going on, but you won't be able to look away either."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,351,"It is rousing fare, made with enough conviction for it to get away with its moments of extreme kitsch silliness."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,352,"Even with its flaws and struggles with originality, Aquaman is reminiscent of the early Marvel movies in its storytelling, best when taking wild swings instead of being an earnest superhero jam."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,353,"Aquaman swims more often than it sinks, buoyed by stunning visuals and an inherently compelling world that should be further developed beyond this origin film."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,354,"This is grandiose, big-budget entertainment at its most self-aware, and even when it swings and misses, it's still a sight to behold."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,355,"This really is the quintessential 21st century popcorn movie. Almost every shot has CGI surrounding the actors, it has a diverse cast, and there's enough action in it that you'll never feel bored."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,356,"The glee that director James Wan clearly has playing in the world of Aquaman is infectious. He's made a movie for both types of 10-year-olds: literal kids and those who are 10 at heart."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,357,"Somehow manages to be the perfect blend of Star Wars, Lord of the Rings and even a little Indiana Jones, yet still manages to be its very own thing."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,358,"Sitting through Aquaman I had that feeling that I was watching a bad movie, but by the time the end credits rolled I had to accept the fact that I was consistently entertained and never bored by James Wan's crazy blockbuster."
Aquaman,Aquaman_rm,359,"""...a candy-colored underwater world that has humor and heart...If you can accept that people ride giant seahorses into battle, you are going to have a blast at this film."""
AvengersEndgame,AvengersEndgame_rm,0,"What you will be getting when you walk into an inevitably overstuffed movie theater is something singular that reflects our age in a way that none of the MCU films that preceded it have-indeed, very few Hollywood spectacles ever have."
AvengersEndgame,AvengersEndgame_rm,1,"What's missing from ""Endgame"" is the free play of imagination, the liberation of speculation, the meandering paths and loose ends that start in logic and lead to wonder."
AvengersEndgame,AvengersEndgame_rm,2,"The MCU will go on and on, but this chapter - and the American pragmatism vs. American ideals bromance that drove it - have well and truly come to their ""Excelsior! Nuff said!"" moment."
AvengersEndgame,AvengersEndgame_rm,3,"Endgame consists almost entirely of the downtime scenes that were always secretly everyone's favorite parts of these movies anyway."
AvengersEndgame,AvengersEndgame_rm,4,"There are horror movies and political dramas with premises less nightmarish than the one in ""Avengers: Endgame... This is an interesting approach for a superhero film to take."
AvengersEndgame,AvengersEndgame_rm,5,"You can easily duck out during the middle hour, do some shopping, and slip back into your seat for the climax. You won't have missed a thing."
AvengersEndgame,AvengersEndgame_rm,6,"Game over man, game over!"

AvengersEndgame,AvengersEndgame_rm,17,"They created a tone within this universe that was set and to-the-point...they made that turn, and they landed it, masterfully."
AvengersEndgame,AvengersEndgame_rm,18,"One of the best movies I've ever seen. One of the best payoffs...I was not disappointed."
AvengersEndgame,AvengersEndgame_rm,19,"So, much to my surprise, I liked this, even at three hours."
AvengersEndgame,AvengersEndgame_rm,20,"Mind-blowing and nail-biting doesn't begin to describe it as the biggest assemblage of Avengers we have seen approach endgame, to provide the perfect send-off for the billions of fans worldwide who have been with them all the way."
AvengersEndgame,AvengersEndgame_rm,21,what I found most impressive about Endgame is how is just as often strikes notes of grace as it does moments of hectic violence

AvengersEndgame,AvengersEndgame_rm,25,"The MCU pictures have always stressed that neither the destination nor the journey are as important as the connections we make along the way. As this is already the most lucrative series ever, clearly that message has struck a chord with millions."
AvengersEndgame,AvengersEndgame_rm,26,"I've already seen it twice, and I want to see it again...a lot of good moments, just great stuff. Thank you, Marvel, and everyone who worked on these movies."
AvengersEndgame,AvengersEndgame_rm,27,"Where Endgame fails its female characters by devaluing them, it forgets its characters of color entirely."
AvengersEndgame,AvengersEndgame_rm,28,"Afterwards, your belly will be full of superhero goodness."
AvengersEndgame,AvengersEndgame_rm,29,"Is it the best superhero movie ever made? In the words of Balki Bartokomous, ""Don't be ridiculous."" (The plotholes are prominent enough to make me consider dropping the rating a half-star.) Nevertheless, this ranks among the upper echelons of the MCU."
AvengersEndgame,AvengersEndgame_rm,30,"An expansive story, a large and unwieldy universe, plenty of knowing callbacks, the willing suspension of disbelief-and a setup for the next one..."
AvengersEndgame,AvengersEndgame_rm,31,"The directors have created a virtual nesting doll of homages which will be appreciated by the most hardcore of fans, but still have value for less devoted fans."
AvengersEndgame,AvengersEndgame_rm,32,"According to Buddhist/Taoist teachings, smaller-particle dimensions are where the heavens are actually located. This is one of the many reasons why ""Avengers"" movies are tales, that by definition, have to be about gods."

AvengersEndgame,AvengersEndgame_rm,438,Avengers: Endgame goes galaxies beyond expectations and exceeds anything that any of us could have imagined. The perfect end to an incredible series of films.
AvengersEndgame,AvengersEndgame_rm,439,"I have to admit, in all its surreal grandiosity, in all its delirious absurdity, there is a huge sugar rush of excitement to this mighty finale, finally interchanging with euphoric emotion and allowing us to say poignant farewells."
AvengersEndgame,AvengersEndgame_rm,440,Our heroes are giving their final bow and it is a joy and pleasure to witness.

AvengersEndgame,AvengersEndgame_rm,442,"Has almost nothing on its mind but crossing the Ts and dotting the Is of a far-flung superhero saga, but to anyone with even a minor emotional stake in the MCU, it has the fleeting satisfaction of a shot of whipped cream direct from the spray can."
AvengersEndgame,AvengersEndgame_rm,443,"Ultimately, Avengers: Endgame feels exhausting. That's not a knock against the movie, though."
AvengersEndgame,AvengersEndgame_rm,444,"Avengers: Endgame is everything you've ever dreamed a Marvel movie could be. It's a three-hour adrenaline shot to the heart featuring mysteries solved, consequences suffered, shock, awe, and delight"

AvengersEndgame,AvengersEndgame_rm,448,Avengers: Endgame is the triumphant crescendo to the biggest film journey that has ever graced cinemas. But casual fans need not apply.
AvengersEndgame,AvengersEndgame_rm,449,"Marvel Studios' previous films have all been leading up to Avengers: Endgame and the film is very much worth the three-hour run time."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,0,"At stake, as ever, is the fate of the universe. Why must it always be the universe? What's wrong with the fate of Hackensack? Doesn't anyone care what happens to South Dakota, or Denmark, or Peru?"
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,1,"The insubstantiality of the film isn't due to the infinite yet flimsy malleability of C.G.I. gimmickry but, instead, to the dispersion of its drama throughout the many cinematic installations set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,2,"Never has the ""Marvel Cinematic Universe"" seemed like more of a universe, in ways both good and bad. Infinity War-the title is almost too apt-is far from a perfect movie, but it is probably close to the best movie it could have been."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,3,"Some of the sequences are undeniably thrilling but, at about 2-1/2 hours, overkill sets in early."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,4,"""Avengers: Infinity War"" isn't just a gussied-up mediocrity being widely mistaken for a good movie. It's also, at least arguably, a dangerous movie for anyone who cares about the future of American cinema."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,5,"Maybe the quips and the punch-ups are there because they have to be, what with the film's steady parade of failure and even death. Plans fail. Character fails. Even sacrifices fail. It's not exactly refreshing, but it is bracing, and even gratifying."

AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,11,The directors demonstrate how to juggle disparate segments while maintaining an emotional thread.

AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,18,"It's still mostly a good movie with a lot of fun scenes. They do a good job balancing all the characters but I did not like the ending"

AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,22,"Directors Joe and Anthony Russo have already demonstrated their ability to keep a lot of superhero plates spinning, but they take their talent to a whole new level here, somehow finding a moment for every character to shine."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,23,"While the movie has all of the humor and wit that have become Marvel's trademark, this is also the darkest and most devastating onscreen offering they've ever given us."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,24,"Personally, I think that most people will either like this movie or love it."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,25,"It manages to give the audience a full gamut of emotions, from rage to heartbreak."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,26,"In the end, the plot of the film was still the same familiar Marvel clichés, just shown from a new perspective."

AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,32,The MCU has arrived at one hell of a climax.
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,33,"[It's] a gargantuan circus tent and functions roughly the same; maybe you don't like every act in the circus, but the ones that you do are worth the admission alone."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,34,"Infinity War es la película más grande que Marvel Studios ha puesto a nuestro alcance, pero con casi veinte películas que le preceden, hay una pequeña sensación de que el MCU nos ha dado todo lo que tenía para ofrecer."

AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,45,"Fantastic fun, though with so many superheroes jostling for position it's hard to delve deep even in 2.5 hours. There are plenty of jokes, some hilarious, some endearingly clunky. Brolin imbues Thanos with remarkable depth."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,46,"For those who have been waiting for this culmination of Marvel's efforts for the past decade, Avengers: Infinity War will be a strong experience."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,47,"The defining chapter in the next step of the world's biggest film series, Avengers: Infinity War has to be seen on the big screen in order to be truly appreciated."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,48,"It's still incomplete and next year's follow-up may change everything, but at the moment, it appears Marvel's ambitious opus, ten years in the making, has been worth the build-up."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,49,"Infinity Wars just doesn't have a lot of style to call its own"
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,50,"Infinity War is not just trash, but it turns age-old questions of faith into trash -- and does it for fun. Maybe the best word for that is: pathetic."

AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,55,"Avengers: Infinity War is like a Thanksgiving feast for Marvel fans. It's the characters we love in action together on a scale we've never seen before. But as a complete experience in and of itself, it just isn't."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,56,Infinity War is not a bad movie by any stretch of the imagination...but it comes off more as the crossover story arc you need instead of the one you really want

AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,70,"While Hindi viewers will be able to follow the vastness of the Marvel universe and enjoy the movie for the big ticket spectacle that it is, we wish the voice cast was kept constant in all the Avenger Hindi dubs."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,71,"This movie is definitely a ""Part 1,"" so final review is reserved for when Part 2 is over, BUT- so much good stuff! (Except the romance. Stop forcing it in, MCU.)"
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,72,"This movie is phenomenal, and it ends in such a poetically beautiful way."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,73,A tremendously satisfying piece of gargantuan blockbuster cinema that delivers as many shocks as it does thrills.

AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,83,Epic.
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,84,Given the monumental task that these filmmakers had they still managed to tell an entertaining story.
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,85,"The film's risk comes from the inherent need to 'balance' a myriad of characters' storylines, yet the story itself is nothing more than those same MCU building blocks."

AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,101,There are too many characters in this movie for anyone to really summarize it in a cohesive manner.

AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,111,"This isn't film, this is manufacturing. [Full Review in Spanish]"

AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,113,"Amidst an ocean of strong performances is a movie that is exciting, exhilarating, tragic, hilariously funny at times, and deadly serious."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,114,"Shockingly short on memorable images, with most scenes composed in the banal shot-reverse-shot coverage familiar from episodic television."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,115,"Infinity War succeeds in sweeping you into a grand adventure and reminding you why you love these characters, but it doesn't solve the narrative problems that haunt Marvel."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,116,"'Infinity War' isn't a life-altering experience that changes the language of film, but it is an ass-kicking popcorn superhero flick that delivers the spectacle fans have waited years for."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,117,"If a movie can be defined by the strength of its villain, Avengers Infinity War is a giant. Towering over the spectacle is Josh Brolin's evil despot Thanos, whose striking capture motion performance and physicality comes close to stealing the film."

AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,124,"As a longtime detester of the MCU machine, I must admit that it brought me some joy."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,125,"Not only is it incomplete despite a running time of 149 minutes... but its action would be meaningless to anyone who hasn't seen a good many previous Marvel pictures."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,126,"It's as good as can be with an overcrowded character stew."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,127,"Everything that has been said about this film, perhaps this year's most anticipated movie, is true."

AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,139,"Infinity War is entertaining and by no means a disappointment, but it's otherwise kind of empty."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,140,Avengers: Infinity War has trouble fitting in so many characters and giving them proper emotional moments as well as the fireworks in its 149 minute run time.
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,141,"Almost 20 movies in, maybe someone should have realized that it wasn't going to be possible to continue topping the previous installments."

AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,143,"The title of this movie should be 'Avengers: Infinity War Part One,' because that is what it is. It is not a movie that stands on its own. It is a leaning monolith that would fall flat without 'Part Two' to lean against."

AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,145,"While the MCU still hasn't gotten the formula quite right for true villainy, they have certainly mastered the equation for entertaining banter & epic superhero moments."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,146,"This is why I find the movie's belief that it's doing something experimental and unprecedented more than uncomfortable: Infinity War gambles dangerously with the way people process real deaths, never mind fictional ones."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,147,"For a movie with a ridiculously unwieldy cast, Infinity War is surprisingly comprehensible and fun."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,148,"""Avengers: Infinity War"" is bold, bombastic, and likely to bum a lot of people out."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,149,"It all amounts to heaps of superhero, everything-and-the-kitchen-sink, asinine spectacle."

AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,151,"Avengers: Infinity Wars is clearly a superhero flick for everybody. At times this works, and at times its excessiveness works a little bit against itself."

AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,162,"Joe and Anthony Russo's film is like an over-egged birthday cake, edible in patches but spoilt by too many competing ingredients."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,163,"The film-making ambition is a joy to behold, the delivery impressive and, as for the spine-tingling ending, well it's close to genius."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,164,"It's non stop, great fun and doesn't feel too long."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,165,"It may still move at hectic speed from one gargantuan punch-up to the next, but - under the direction of Joe and Anthony Russo - it's well paced for the sort of extravaganza it is. The all-star parade never becomes a pile-up."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,166,"Faced with such brilliant results, there is no alternative but to look forward to how the story will continue... [Full review in Spanish]"
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,167,The chemistry between Robert Downey Jr. and Benedict Cumberbatch is perfect... [Full review in Spanish]
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,168,A bloated-yet-breezy blockbuster.
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,169,"All-in-all, Avengers: Infinity War is a pretty big success. It's rather incredible that these guys were able to cram so much into one epic-sized film and have it turn out this well."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,170,"For fans, this is the pay-off you've been waiting for, which is saying something. It's the most epic MCU film to date."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,171,"The major concession is that the film's organic structure and its resistance to showcase one indestructible character adds much-needed spontaneity to Marvel Studios' ageing formula."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,172,"Avengers: Infinity War is more than just a great superhero movie. The emotional impact on the audience, the artistry, and the brilliant storytelling are so astonishingly good, that it is simply a great film. Period."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,173,"The movie equivalent of a theme park ride. Has highs, lows, excitement and an ending to make sure you wanna go on it again... after you've regained your breath. [Full review in Spanish]"
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,174,"This chaotic but surprisingly nimble instalment, directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, brings together an eye-popping ensemble cast of A-listers (imagine the table read!) and pushes them into playful new configurations."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,175,Thanos is given tremendous emotional depth and development but the rest of the vast superhero pantheon appear to have been given two hours of busy work.
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,176,"... witnessing the selfless struggle of it all unfolding has both the necessary epic feel of a summer blockbuster infused with all the heart fans have come to expect from Marvel - 'nuff said."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,177,"One has to treat the culmination of 10 years of Marvel movies as a season finale, or at least the first part of a season finale. It's not really a movie in its own right."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,178,"If some pacing issues and the occasional bloat prevent it from quite reaching the upper echelons of the MCU, there's still more than enough here to keep viewers sated, saturated, and salivating over what's certain to be a poignant and potent Part Deux."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,179,"Feels more like several movies squished together like a cinematic panini. Still, it's easy to be swept along by Banner's Hulkus Interruptus condition that frustrates him mightily."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,180,"Nothing is solved as fighters on both sides die and that's the end of the story. ...So what's left?"
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,181,"While this is a massive comic-book spectacle, what's most amazing is how - after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1996 - Marvel, led by Kevin Feige, now dominates the global box-office."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,182,"It is a massive spectacle full of fun character moments, impressive action sequences and a real sense of stakes."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,183,"This is an epic tale sheathed in spandex, a super heroic soap opera. The Russos know how to deliver the bang, but also when to lay back."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,184,"The film plays like an ""event book"" reads"
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,185,"It's fine, but you wonder how they can expect you to care about an earth-shattering conclusion when the previous two hours (and 18 movies) were all about these magic stones that can undo anything."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,186,"This blockbuster leaves you wildly curious about the sequel, even if you are not an Avengers fanatic."

AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,188,"As it is, everything feels like a bait and switch."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,189,"Avengers: Infinity War isn't a perfect film, but it's probably exactly what it wants to be."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,190,"This is probably the best, if not second best, movie in the MCU...this movie makes some bold, heavy choices."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,191,My default feeling throughout was numbness bordering on fatigue.
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,192,"Thanks to Thanos, Infinity War is much more than a two-part blockbuster, and for the first time in a long time, we can't easily anticipate more of the same, because the road ahead for superheroes is murky, complicated, and terrifying."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,193,This is a wildly entertaining movie but one that leaves too many unanswered questions.
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,194,"Enjoyable but empty, Avengers: Infinity War embodies the humdrum side of the MCU."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,195,"It's freakishly big. It encompasses dozens of characters. It has a million moving parts. So the good news about Avengers is that this culmination of a 10-year story loop is relatively coherent."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,196,"All-all-all, Infinity War is a film that surpasses most superhero films in terms of vision, scale, grandeur and execution."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,197,"Too long, too dark, too confusing - and it should state up front it is part one of a ""to be continued"" movie. The humor helps you endure the overrunning length."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,198,"How does art land in the world? Genre filmmaking at its best provides topical spark, often beyond the will of its creators."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,199,"Everyone shows up in this film, there is not a single weak performance to speak of."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,200,"As expected, Avengers: Infinity War has one of the most sensational and complicated group of action scenes in the MCU so far. This is, after all, the big fight."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,201,"But that all goes to show that Infinity War is the kind of film that reels you in and you become emotionally invested. I'll definitely be watching again."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,202,"Clocking in at more than two-and-a-half hours, Infinity War never drags. Having multiple characters and storylines to cut back and forth between helps build a sense of pace."

AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,209,"Infinity War is an achievement unparalleled in movie history, the culmination of 10 years, 19 movies and comic book stories going back to 1941 when Captain America was originally created by Jack Kirby."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,210,[Infinity War] delivers on its promises without exceeding itself and also drops various surprises to various characters that we have seen grow throughout the last decade. [Full Review in Spanish]
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,211,"Despite its weak book end, ""Infinity War"" is a great adaptation and stellar crossover..."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,212,"Although I know that I disliked Avengers: Infinity War long before it arrived at its long-overdue climax, that sequence is the part that I disliked the most."

AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,216,"This jumping backwards and forwards from too many plot threads sometimes dissipates the tension and over-complicates everything. Fortunately, the contractually-impossible cast is mostly in strong form."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,217,"It's ironic that one of Marvel's darkest films is also one of its most fun, with the character banter and personality clashes that have made so many Marvel movies memorable in full abundance."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,218,"Whether the wit fizzes or flops, a Marvel movie will always live or die by its action set-pieces. And in this latest adventure, they are truly spectacular..."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,219,"For a movie with dozens of superheroes battling in half a dozen war-torn worlds, Marvel's penultimate epic is remarkably orderly."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,220,"Intense violence, strong messages in shocking Marvel epic."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,221,"On the surface Avengers: Infinity War feels like the usual winning formula. But as the film unfolds you realise it is a monumental undertaking, gradually emerging as the War And Peace of superhero movies."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,222,"Slightly above average for an MCU movie, though more of a triumph of continuity than of entertainment or filmmaking."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,223,"There's just too much of this thing."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,224,"What prevents Avengers: Infinity War from being as entertaining as some of its predecessors is that there aren't many small moments that make the explosions and CGI monsters more meaningful."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,225,Infinity War feels about as emotionally empty as a child slamming action figures together.
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,226,"Thanos is an idiot, but neither he nor the filmmakers know this."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,227,"Avengers: Infinity War is almost unwieldy, but as always, the strength of this deep cast and their ability to balance serious stakes and snarky humor gets it right."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,228,"It lifts, inspires and stings in a raw way that studio blockbusters rarely manage."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,229,"Given that the plot motor is Thanos's worry that the universe is overpopulated, sly self-awareness is shown as the filmmakers embrace drastic solutions to the problems of braiding multiple franchises into one."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,230,An impressive feat simply because of the discipline and skill required to deliver so much in such a comparatively tight package.
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,231,"The movie is packed with fun banter and set pieces, but it's not really about anything, and the ending falls flat."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,232,"Infinity War gets by with a witty first hour and the starry appeal of the cast, but the gears really grind near the finish."

AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,234,"All I know is that Marvel has lived up to its reputation for daring its filmmakers to break boundaries, and trusting its audience to go along for the ride. I don't think fans will be disappointed."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,235,"Avengers: Infinity War is everything you wanted and more - it's the end of the beginning of the end, an ambitious spectacle that confidently juggles character moments between the most epic action Marvel has ever attempted."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,236,"Thankfully, this $300 million entry into the Marvel comic-book movie universe is one of the better films pumped out by Marvel Studios and certainly makes up for the tornado of dung that was Avengers: Age of Ultron."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,237,"A totally different beast: darker, riskier, and more brutal. [Full review in Spanish]"
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,238,A disenchanting rain of colors that spans 150 minutes that will continue for years to come. [Full review in Spanish]
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,239,"Ten years of Marvel superheroism culminates in a battle for the universe itself. Exhausting, bitterly humorous, and gripped in a stunning finality, it's almost too much to take in, yet somehow not enough."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,240,The outcome satisfyingly tops the trip and resonates long after you leave the theater. [Full Review in Spanish]
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,241,"Because so much is purposefully unresolved and so little is actually decided, I just can't say I enjoyed watching Infinity War all that much."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,242,I had a lot of fun with the action and amusing banter and did not mind being inundated with CGI or the 2+ hour run time.
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,243,"While these films have been flooding the market, you've got to hand it to uber-producer Kevin Feige whose grand design comes into sharper and sharper focus."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,244,"If you thought Marvel was flagging after ten years of relentless action, Infinity War Part 1 suggests they haven't even got started."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,245,"It's a rollercoaster ride that leaves you breathless, invested and eventually panting for more. Marvel's Cinematic Universe really is something to savour and hold up as special."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,246,"It's a long but slight, expansive but restricted, and busy but straightforward contradiction of a movie."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,247,The fact is that in Infinity War... everyone has their moment and meshes perfectly with the whole. [Full review in Spanish]
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,248,"It's stunning to realize that their attempts to do so are the most emotionally affecting things in the whole of the perfectly-named Infinity War: people valiantly, desperately trying to evoke humanity in the midst of a machine that makes that impossible."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,249,"The Russos, while tipping their hat to these individual filmmakers who put their unique stamp on each of their own films, elevate their own art and skilfully weave a story that seems cohesive and resonant, physically and emotionally."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,250,"The equivalent of a bad one-night stand with a very weak climax that you wish would've ended much, much sooner."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,251,"But on the whole, Infinity War is what fans have been clamoring for - an action movie that puts everyone under one cinematic roof, that pits all of the good guys against the ultimate big bad for all of the marbles in the universe."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,252,"Over the last decade, the Marvel movies have shown us they can be more - weirder, funnier, more eccentric, even more politically loaded than simple adventure stories. This one feels like a step backward."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,253,"Expect to be mightily entertained by this offering that expertly mixes action and comedy before segueing into something that sort of reaches for Shakespearean levels. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Profanity, etc. - also Available)"
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,254,The [Russo] brothers clearly know what clicks and to keep things moving.
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,255,"By the time Infinity War draws to its enigmatic whopper of a close, even viewers feeling burned out by the guys-in-long-underwear genre will find themselves eager for the sequel. Is it next summer yet?"
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,256,"Yes, I want to see the next Marvel movie. But I long for popcorn movies like the last couple of Mission: Impossible installments, in which, after two-plus hours of ridiculously entertaining action, the mission actually is accomplished."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,257,"This is a movie that needs the other 18 to exist before it. Otherwise, we'd know very little about these characters, their concerns, and why we should care for them."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,258,"If Infinity War were the Second World War, I'd go all Churchill and declare that this is not even the beginning of the end. But it is definitely the end of the beginning."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,259,"'Epic' doesn't even begin to describe this mind-exploding spectacle."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,260,"Infinity War is, in short, an astonishing and impossible achievement."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,261,"It's the sense that everything has been building to this moment and now, as the fun truly begins, there's nothing left to do but sit back and revel in the spectacle of it all."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,262,"There's a lot to meditate on in this breathlessly told comic book adventure film."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,263,"A film that's overlong and overstuffed but somehow avoids being a chore to watch."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,264,"There's a lot going on in Infinity War, including actual suffering, sacrifice and real emotions, most of which won't sink in until the end credits roll."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,265,"...as much a fantastic amusement park ride as a cinematic experience, with an engaging cast doing an incredible job of not getting lost in the proceedings."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,266,"Intriguing, but virtually devoid of suspense. Funny, but pressing too hard for laughs. Monotonous, but not boring...Still, the ambitious Infinity War should be mandatory viewing for serious Marvel movie fans."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,267,"There is whip-smart warfront humor to lighten the mood but, most importantly, in bleak times on and off the screen, they give us something vital: hope."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,268,"Infinity War's place in the Avengers saga is much like that of the middle chapters in the Lord of the Rings and Star Wars: It's chief purpose is to leave you hungry for next summer's finale. And that much, it does."

AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,272,You know all that Infinity War hype? It lives up to it. And then some.
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,273,"Relentless, entertaining and more than a touch surprising, yet starved of substance and likely to leave many feeling shortchanged."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,274,"It's crowded, busy and noisy--and if you're a Marvel fan, pretty close to heaven."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,275,Avengers: Infinity War does the impossible. It tops all previous 19 Marvel movies while continuing to redefine the action genre.
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,276,"For all the blockbuster spectacle on display, the film ends up in a place that's unexpectedly poetic and poignant, proving that even a movie of this size still has the ability to surprise - and more to the point: tell a good story."

AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,278,"After 2.5 hours of watching superheroes battle dark forces, I'm exhausted. And elated."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,279,"There are some decent laughs before things turn serious, and the deft timing that has always been one of the sneakier pleasures of this multi-chapter behemoth is in evidence as heroes collide in attitude and physique."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,280,"Infinity War inherits plenty of the problems endemic to crossovers: the privileging of quantity over quality, of spectacle over story, and of the shock value of major changes to the status quo over just about everything else."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,281,"Equal parts exciting and exhausting, the film's resonant emotional crux and solid supervillain are unfortunately outweighed by an overwhelming amount of ambition and scope."

AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,283,"Hail, hail --- the gang's all here! ""Avengers: Infinity War"" is totally thrilling, hilarious and vastly entertaining!"
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,284,"The reported budget of about $300 million should, in all likelihood, look like a bargain when the final returns are tallied."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,285,"The scope of the movie is massive. Yet, it feels intimate because, through the previous Marvel movies, we have become emotionally invested in many of these characters."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,286,"Infinity War certainly isn't totally perfect, but it's a damn fun time that rises to its challenge."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,287,"""Infinity War"" isn't concerned with endings, but as set-ups go, it's a humdinger, going apocalyptic while still retaining familiar beats of humor, heart, and body-smashing confrontations."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,288,"In some sense, this is every Marvel movie combined. So if the first installment of the two-part culmination of all that effort seems a bit loaded, I'd say other critics need to put their nitpicky hats away. This is for the fans, and they have earned it."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,289,Avengers: Infinity War changes everything... maybe.

AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,298,The flavors of this multi-movie sundae blend beautifully.
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,299,Marvel betrays the richness of its comic books in pursuit of the bedazzlement of the modern blockbuster movie; leaving us undernourished but entertained.

AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,301,"Somehow nearly every story that's been started in this cinematic universe gets serviced. That's no small feat for a series that centers on more than a dozen different characters, and yet still manages to make every one of them count."

AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,307,"Maybe ""Deadpool 2"" will be better..."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,308,"Never boring, visually impressive, but ultimately rather depressing and unsatisfying, Infinity War will leave you wanting more. But not necessarily in the best way."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,309,"It took us 19 movies over a span of 11 years to finally reach this destination. The end result? ""Infinity War"" is just too much of everything."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,310,"It's too much. Too many characters, too much action, too much everything. It's a superhero surplus with too many heroes and not enough screen. It's Infinity overload."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,311,Sitting through its 2 hours and 30 minutes is like gorging on tapas: You wind up both overstuffed and unsatisfied.
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,312,"Even by Marvel's own standards of serviceable mediocrity, Infinity War fails."

AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,316,"The noisy, bloated spectacles of combat were surely the most expensive parts of the movie, but the money seems less like an imaginative tool than a substitute for genuine imagination."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,317,"Throughout the film, rapidity of dialogue and drama is mistaken for actual rhythm, of which directors Anthony and Joe Russo have one mode: pedal-to-the-metal pandemonium."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,318,"Love or loathe the genre, when I see a film this ambitious actually hitting its targets AND managing to stay human and accessible, I can't help but be extraordinarily impressed."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,319,"The best Marvel film ever-the most complete, the most emotional, and the most thrilling."

AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,321,"Only now could the MCU arrive at a place where bluffs can be irrefutably called and gauntlets, real or metaphorical, can be thrown down. With audacity and thoughtfulness, ""Infinity War"" upends the comparative breeziness of all that came before it."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,322,"It's effective at being all the things it needs to be, even if that necessity is the thing that holds it back the most."

AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,324,"This movie isn't actually about the Avengers. It's about Thanos."
AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,325,"There is a fissure between critics and audiences, which I can admit. The movie is critic-proof. 'Avengers: Infinity War' is superhero porn, strictly for the fans, while 'Black Panther' was undeniably excellent, transcending the comic book fan base."

AvengersInfinityWar,AvengersInfinityWar_rm,328,"AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR is nearly spread too thin by its massive amount of plot and characters. It redeems itself by being full of surprises and foreboding; focusing on the heroes' relationships and real peril in fierce, unrestrained action."

BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,259,"The continent that gave birth to humanity won't look the same on the big screen ever again thanks to the introduction of Wakanda, the fictional home of the most technologically advanced people on the planet."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,260,"Coogler and his talented cast and team tell a story that dazzles, one that dares its audience to dream of a world unrestrained by our own stifling reality, without ignoring how the pain of the real world informs those joyful dreams."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,261,This film is a giant middle finger to all things authoritarian.
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,262,"Black Panther could have been just another Marvel romp-a fun but ultimately disposable entry in the studio's catalogue. But Ryan Coogler and company had the power, and perhaps the responsibility, to do much more. And they did."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,263,"Classic comic-book stuff made fresh by drawing on underexplored mythologies and cultures, yet still deeply resonant and deeply universal. An exhilarating pulp-fiction dream that ups the ante on the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,264,"The wildly enjoyable 'Black Panther' claws its way to the top of the Marvel Universe."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,265,"You can feel the sameness of Black Panther ... Watching the film, though, is to see something completely different in the realm of these stories."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,266,"The film per se is correct, but it is not the masterpiece of action cinema that will mark paragons, nor set the bar higher... [Full review in Spanish]"
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,267,...the free-est film in the MCU. [Full Review in Spanish]
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,268,Black Panther is a superhero film that manages to achieve moments of cinematic clarity that all great films do. It is worth your time and it will spark your imagination.
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,269,"But the most revolutionary thing about Black Panther is its city. The capital of Wakanda has skyscrapers, a monorail, sidewalks of grass, green buildings, farmers markets, and no cars."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,270,"One of the year's best films, and one that transcends the superhero genre to emerge as an epic of operatic proportions."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,271,"Believe the hype: ""Black Panther"" transcends its comic-book origins, achieving a mythic grandeur that's nothing short of exhilarating."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,272,"It is a landmark moment in blockbuster cinema that couldn't be more timely or more confident in its ability to be so."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,273,"[The] script adheres to the usual genre formula of tomfoolery, in-jokes, mythology and outright poppycock, but their knack for teasing emotional resonance out of standard scenarios gives them the edge over predecessors and competitors alike."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,274,"Destined to be celebrated, and for good reason; this may not be the first film featuring a black superhero, but it is groundbreaking all the same for being the first of this scale."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,275,"It's more than just an overdue step of onscreen representation. It's also a rollicking good blockbuster, even if it doesn't quite reinvent the wheel."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,276,"""Black Panther"" is so worth the hype."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,277,"A beautiful, hallucinatory sequence, as Killmonger reaches peak villain and assumes his powers, is the most dramatically fraught and heart-wrenching moment in any Marvel movie."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,278,A fresh new Marvel superhero movie unlike any other.
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,279,"Black Panther is a pretty entertaining film and an important one, even though it stops short of being a great one."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,280,"[Chadwick] Boseman carries that moral and emotional weight to reaffirm him as one of Marvel's finest casting choices"
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,281,"Like T'Challa's step toward becoming a world leader, Black Panther shows the next generation of comic book films how it's done."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,282,The richness of the visual palette here is dazzling.
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,283,"Will play well across the board and thankfully features more depth than your typical superhero movie fare. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Profanity, etc. - also Available)"
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,284,"This is serious superhero business. That gravity is the movie's strength and weakness."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,285,"Yes, this ""Black Panther"" is red-hot. Wakanda forever!"
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,286,"Forget a lethal presidential Twitter account, King T'Challa has drank some kind of tea made from a Heart-Shaped Herb enabling him to take on an army. ""Black Panther"" pulls the right emotional levers focusing on the theme of the forgotten and the lost."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,287,"Black Panther is a feast for the eyes, the ears, the heart and the mind, a film that has action, heart, substance, and soul."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,288,"In the red, white and blue hue-niverse of superhero colors, black is the new beautiful."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,289,"An insipid, soulless, and overproduced bore."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,290,"Like the best blockbusters it's flawed but ridiculously entertaining anyway, and like too few of them it's also so incredibly important."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,291,Michael B. Jordan gives a hell of a performance. Maybe people will stop blaming him for FF and give him his due. Killmonger is one of the best characters Marvel has ever created. Stop using the Race card to promote this film.
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,292,"That's the sound of the game being changed and everyone is going to have to follow the King. This should signal a major change to the superhero film landscape for years."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,293,"A wonderful sense of culture and costumed authority, creating a vibrant solo showcase for the world of Wakanda and all the political turbulence and fierceness it contains."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,294,"The good definitely outweighs the problematic here, making for a superhero movie that's definitely one of the better examples of the genre though hardly as groundbreaking as some would claim."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,295,Black Panther is a great MCU superhero adventure that smoothly blends rich narrative substance with sheer popcorn entertainment.
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,296,"This is an origin story, globe-trotting spy thriller and fantasy, all in one. The movie manages to be part of, but something completely different than, the Marvel superhero movies that came before."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,297,"Black Panther is, without a doubt, the coolest superhero movie to come prowling out of Marvel Studios."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,298,"All hail Ryan Coogler, the Black Panther, the Dora Milaje, and everyone who helped to bring this next-level, majestic, and wildly entertaining superhero movie to life."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,299,"What's honestly amazing about this film is that I'm not thinking about the action, the cool epic moments...I'm thinking about the things that shape these characters into who they become...I have to commend Black Panther, but it's not a film without flaws."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,300,"Black Panther was fantastic. It has the fun superhero stuff, but that's not really what it's about...they bring you in on a fascinating, colorful, vibrant civilization."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,301,"With a bloated 2 hour, 15 minute running time, Coogler ran out of ideas."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,302,"... while Nyong'o and Wright get the most playfully lively opportunities to charm, it is the fiercely dedicated passion Gurira brings to her portrayal of the warrior Okoye that impressed me the most."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,303,"If Wakanda, invisible to the naked eye yet brimming with futuristic technology that could better the entire planet, is a beautifully depicted metaphor for representation, then Killmonger is a manifestation of African-American pain past and present"
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,304,"Black Panther proves how representation can rejuvenate even the oldest superhero origin arcs, allowing Marvel a victory that still feels every bit a Ryan Coogler film."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,305,"There's talent in every corner of the film, and it elevates Black Panther beyond so many of its superhero contemporaries even as it exhibits some formulaic tendencies."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,306,"A vibrant film that beautifully blends superhero action with a poignant, Shakespearean-in-scope story."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,307,"All of these conflicts are eventually resolved in the conventional framework of a Marvel action movie... More unconventional are Coogler's ideas."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,308,"It is a terrifically entertaining film, alive from the start, following its Marvel mission (for good and bad) while rising above it."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,309,"This is 2018's first great motion picture - a title that will surely be remembered when ""end of the year"" bests are discussed."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,310,"Iron Man tries too hard and Captain America is far too earnest to be cool but Black Panther, both Chadwick Boseman's portrayal of the character and the film that surrounds him, is just effortlessly cool."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,311,"In Black Panther, Coogler and company have made a superhero picture that's twice as good, twice as smart, twice as fun to look at as any before it. May they get twice the credit and twice the box office."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,312,"That's some complex stuff for a superhero movie, and Coogler and co-screenwriter Joe Robert Cole give it the emotional weight it deserves."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,313,The results are astonishing.
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,314,"Between Black Panther's Black Lives Matter subtext and its use of female characters as more than window dressing both in front of and behind the camera ... it seems as though Hollywood has, for one shining moment, caught up with the real world."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,315,"Smart, accessible, and thoroughly fun, Black Panther is a new high for Marvel Studios."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,316,Black Panther is one of the best superhero movies of the century.
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,317,"""Black Panther"" is the superhero movie - no, movie, no qualifier necessary - that we need, right here, right now."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,318,"[Ryan] Coogler's overall ambition in crafting a sociologically complex story and presenting it as standard comic book movie fare succeeds: There is nothing common about Black Panther."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,319,"[Chadwick] Boseman is perfect as the Panther, just the right mixture of royal privilege and humility, in a story that allows for a sense of wonder rarely found in ""comic book movies."""
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,320,"To the infinite credit of Coogler and his team, Black Panther fights constantly and bitterly against the familiar constraints of Disney's superhero industrial complex."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,321,"It's very, very good -- in its best scenes, exhilarating."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,322,"The bad guy is so brilliantly realized by Coogler's frequent collaborator Michael B. Jordan as Erik ""Killmonger"" Stevens, a former Navy SEAL gone bad."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,323,"It is modern, sharp and cool, honoring the past as well as the present, and pushing the boundaries of the genre past what audiences are used to from superhero movies."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,324,"...a cinematically holistic work of diversity, in which cultural identity has been carefully woven into every element of the movie."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,325,"Letitia Wright steals the thunder as T'Challa's younger sister and Wakanda's tech and weapons genius. I would love to see her and Tony Stark in the same room, just to watch them out-geeking each other."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,326,"It's possible to love Black Panther but be conflicted, but still love it, but still be conflicted, all the while sharing in the unmitigated joy of its existence."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,327,Black is beautiful.
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,328,"Black Panther, a gleaming example of Afrofuturism, provides a unique perspective on a well-worn genre."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,329,These are no small ideas. This cogent screenplay serves up the obligatory superhero trappings -- but it addresses real-world issues of global propriety and responsibility with an underlying sense of gravity.
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,330,"Black Panther might be the first MCU film that could claim to most clearly be an expression of a particular director's voice."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,331,"Boilerplate Marvel, with a sleek, colorful look, cheeky humor, and familiar action beats...But Coogler brings enough to the table for a fresh vision, broadly appealing as well as inspirational in its representation for black audiences and women."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,332,"One of the best films from Marvel, thanks to it's richness in culture and mythology, and one of the best villains to date. Michael B. Jordan is fantastic. [Full review in Spanish]"
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,333,"Black Panther is worthy, no question, but it's also a little dull."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,334,The plotting is predictable and the action sequences for the most part unengaging. Black Panther is a major disappointment.
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,335,"May Marvel learn its lesson from ""Black Panther"": When a movie like this ends up feeling both personal and vital, you've done something right."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,336,"Chadwick Boseman commands every moment of this film, radiating probity and purpose, and it's only later on that you realize that, with another actor, this wouldn't have been a sure thing."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,337,"It's taken a decade and 18 films, but the Marvel Cinematic Universe has finally produced a superhero movie that feels like it was ripped from the pages of a comic book."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,338,"Coogler is a young filmmaker - this is just his third feature, following ""Fruitvale Station"" and ""Creed"" (two fine and very different films) - but he marshals this world with confidence and flair."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,339,"Like all the best comics movies, this one's got a villain (Michael B. Jordan) so compelling he nearly steals the show from the hero (Chadwick Boseman)."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,340,"Noble and worthwhile, but slow and frankly generic, save for the terrific African touches."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,341,Marvel Studios has yet again managed to blend together familiar elements into something that feels new with Black Panther.
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,342,"Marvel's Black Panther is a complete triumph and is simply one of the best Marvel Cinematic Universe entries yet."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,343,"Whilst a Marvel story through and through, fitting perfectly into the MCU post-Captain America: Civil War, Black Panther stands alone as a masterpiece of filmmaking."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,344,"There's a whole lot going on in this latest Marvel chapter. And boy, are we all the better for it."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,345,...a song of freedom within the genre. [Full Review in Spanish]
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,346,"Coogler delivers action with frenetic grace, keeping the violence more intimate than usual for a superhero movie. Less soulless metropolis crumbling and more face-to-face combat (although the armored rhinos aren't bad)."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,347,"The true knockout stars are Lupita Nyong'o as Wakandan spy Nakia and Danai Gurira as Dora Milaje general Okoye."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,348,"After this first trip to Wakanda, some will never want to visit that country again. Others, who already know their wonders, will want to visit it again ...but only in vignettes. [Full review in Spanish]"
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,349,"Coogler builds a thrilling, exciting world, and threads throughout it a story filled with pathos and real-world gravitas."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,350,Black Panther comes to life with a real brio and glee...
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,351,"It was gripping, it was invigorating, the action was so cool!"
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,352,"... a film that fulfills the most rote demands of superhero spectacle, yet does so with style and subtexts that feel bracingly, joyfully groundbreaking."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,353,"Even if you are not a fan of superhero movies you may find the issues explored thought provoking. It is also action packed, well acted, dazzlingly shot by English cinematographer Rachel Morrison and... full of humour and self-aware wisecracks."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,354,This is a movie whose political theory matches its stunning special effects.
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,355,"A witty, action-packed epic, this adventure delivers a vibrant twist to the comic book movie formula while remaining true to the Marvel Universe it belongs to."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,356,"Black Panther sees female characters finally given space to shine in a Marvel movie, and shining brightest of all is Letitia Wright."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,357,"Coogler puts all the will-they-won't-they 'black Bond' speculation to rest by effectively getting there first, from the fascination with gadgetry to the thrilling set-pieces."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,358,Ryan Coogler has eschewed the familiar Marvel glut of smug in-jokes and mind-numbing CGI explosions to create a visually dazzling work of art.
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,359,"It's the kind of art that's aggressively theatrical, but not even for a moment does it feel performative."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,360,This cool cat more than earns his stripes.
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,361,Brilliantly cast and impeccably directed - the most exciting MCU entry in years.
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,362,"For all their global dominance, everybody wants these superhero movies to be better: funnier, smarter, more inclusive, more super. A huge step in the right direction, Black Panther is that dream come true."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,363,"[Director Ryan Coogler has] raised the bar even higher here. Visually, Black Panther is unlike any movie I've ever seen."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,364,"The movie has a beating heart, and a big one; it's not just sincere, but that rarest of birds in the jungle of mainstream entertainment, a heartfelt epic."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,365,"What you don't expect from Marvel is a thoughtful story steeped in political parallels and the historical baggage of racial discrimination and suffering. That's what makes Black Panther unique among a teeming movie universe of extraordinary beings."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,366,"Black Panther is a story we haven't seen told before in popular cinema - a story about black people completely untouched by colonialism, who exist entirely outside the global systems of institutionalized racism."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,367,"As the MCU lumbers to something of a climax in Avengers: Infinity War and looks beyond, the solid and satisfying Black Panther is a good standard-bearer for the next era... It's earnest, regal and ready to take over the MCU mantle."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,368,"There is a lot going on in here, but again, a confident Coogler takes a frighteningly tall tale and somehow manages to make a clean, thrilling and largely inventive sci-fi adventure out of it."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,369,This is one superhero film that definitely punches above the normal crash-bang-wallop weight. The Marvel Cinematic Universe just got a whole lot more interesting.
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,370,"Visually, ""Black Panther"" is often spectacular...It's warriors with spears and force-field shields. It's aircraft that soar and swoop like birds over the Serengeti. It's ""Blade Runner"" in Dar es Salaam instead of L.A."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,371,"Even if it had nothing else going for it, Black Panther would still be the best-looking Marvel movie yet."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,372,"Until the formulaic final quarter, the film is fast, enjoyable and has several funny moments. The main actors are engaging, and its fun being introduced to new faces too."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,373,"Black Panther is to the ongoing Marvel project as Coogler's Creed was to the Rocky movies - a film simultaneously beholden to its franchise and alive to every possibility within it, creating a new world within the existing master narrative."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,374,"Coogler and his team have conjured a universe and fleshed out its players, one existing (honestly, thriving) in the even bigger cinematic universe that is Marvel."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,375,"Not since Ant-Man has a Marvel film actually been about the hero in the title, but Black Panther is and it makes it all the better."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,376,"Black Panther proves that you can make a movie that is significant to the black audience, and just a damn good superhero movie that everyone can enjoy."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,377,"It may be named Black Panther, but the film is very much an ensemble piece with enough action and social commentary to carve out a place as one of Marvel's better standalone offerings."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,378,...Black Panther is one of the best Marvel films ever.
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,379,"A Shakespearean flavoured tragedy to its backstory, with palace intrigue and hidden secrets. Where Serkis's maniacally-laughing Klaue is a bad guy who wears thin, Killmonger is one of the few movie villains I've ever felt sorry for."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,380,"The film constantly manages to subvert expectations, while remaining firmly within the action-packed superhero genre."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,381,Exactly the kind of risk Marvel should be taking with every film they make.
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,382,"Soundtracked by an authentic score, the movie has an electric rhythmicality; every scene bounces as if dancing to the beat of its own drum."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,383,"Makes the Marvel Cinematic Universe a bigger, more interesting, more engaging place, one where for the first time women and people of color aren't limited to token or supporting roles."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,384,"Dialogue heavy with a confused sense of place, this mega-budget Marvel marvel might be a misfire for anyone beyond the fan-base..."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,385,"Unlike a Tony Stark who can entertain with his dry wit or Captain America who dazzles with his passion for patriotism, Boseman must play both T'Challa as a man of great reserve. He's a warrior, but one who rules the screen with a quiet calm."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,386,"Looking, sounding and feeling the way it does-wearing its anti-corporate, anti-fascist, anti-racist heart on its sleeve-it's a movie that, for sure, knows what's up."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,387,"But what no trailer could prepare us for is director Ryan Coogler's skills at perfectly weaving socio-political lessons on love, culture community, isolation, personal responsibility and identity in between some pretty dope fight scenes."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,388,"An ineffably adventurous, vibrant and compelling production. It's a blockbuster that is saying something, and believe me Marvel, we're listening."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,389,"Michel B. Jordan plays Erik Killmonger with such moving, occasionally gut-wrenching commitment that it nearly mitigates the goofiness of his moniker and the superficiality of the film in toto."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,390,"With gorgeous visuals from Wakanda to South Korea and back, vivid and bold Afrocentric costumes, and the support of some pretty bad-ass women, Black Panther is progressive, exciting, enveloping, and exactly what we all need in our lives right now."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,391,"The first studio produced, major motion picture to feature a Black superhero Black Panther is a very good movie, exceptional beyond its big-budget entertainment values..."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,392,"Black Panther spirals into a stodgy tale of internecine feuding, in which T'Challa is required to come to terms with the sins of past generations. What he doesn't get to do much of is jump around beating-up bad guys. That's a shame."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,393,"Crashingly enjoyable, frequently exciting and even, when it wants, borderline witty."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,394,"It feels rich, expansive, and is clearly teeming with umpteen further stories, while it is also distinctive, authentic, and has a vitality that you can't help but become invested in."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,395,"... it's a very rich buffet - geopolitical thriller, futuristic fantasy, coming-of-age story, African adventure with mystical overtones... it offers a wide variety of tastes and sensations but they never really come together to form a satisfying whole."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,396,"Ryan Coogler's spectacular first foray into the Marvel universe is an absolute game-changer."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,397,"Rarely has a superhero origin story been as satisfying as Black Panther, which in many ways doesn't feel like a typical Marvel movie - and more power to that."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,398,"Black Panther doesn't just hit its marks. It leaves marks. Landmarks. So get in the queue now, people."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,399,"Despite familiar action-scene wobbliness, it's easily the most engaging Marvel film in a long while. Because-finally!-it has something new to say. More like this please, Marvel. Oh, and, of course: Wakanda forever."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,400,Coogler was clearly given the freedom to explore his chosen themes and step outside the MCU mould.
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,401,"""Black Panther"" matters."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,402,"Black Panther succeeds at being emotionally resonant in a way a lot of Marvel movies-a lot of blockbusters, period-don't."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,403,"The action sequences meet, but do not exceed, the industry standard."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,404,"Hi-tech gadgets, jungle combat, vehicle chases, ready-made quips, casino hookups - there's something very James Bond-esque about Black Panther."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,405,"""Black Panther"" doesn't disappoint. It is splendidly endowed with awesome wizardry."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,406,"The set designs are extraordinary, and the movie features a surprise ending --- especially for those who left the theatre prematurely --- with a timely message about international togetherness."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,407,"Proves a Marvel film can aspire to be something more; it has political bite, emotional depth, ethical dilemmas, and regal jostling, but it still manages to maintain a bombastic comic book aesthetic that's spectacular."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,408,"Black Panther is a comic masterpiece that transcends the genre. Michael B. Jordan is fantastic as Eric Killmonger, the best villain yet from Marvel Studios."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,409,The most visually arresting and memorable Marvel film to date.
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,410,Black Panther is absolutely majestic.
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,411,"Above all, this is a superbly acted movie, stolen without remorse by Letitia Wright's work as Shuri, T'Challa's whip-smart sister, who outfits him with all of his vibranium-enhanced tech."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,412,"The women of Black Panther do so much throughout the film, all while being funny, sensuous, smart and strong."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,413,"...perhaps the most complete on screen encapsulation of the wild flights of imagination comics are capable of, grounded in astute, modern political sensibilities..."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,414,"Black Panther is set largely in Wakanda, with a detour to South Korea. Still, there's no shaking the feeling that this is what America looks like when it's allowed to be its truest, freest self. That's a superhero challenge if ever there was one."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,415,"While ultimately an action-adventure, Black Panther also serves as an intelligent if broad debate between revolutionary rhetoric and the responsibilities of leadership."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,416,"[A] tour de force, one of the smartest, most original action-packed blockbusters of the decade... bold and visually stunning filmmaking..."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,417,I hope people notice how much drama Coogler got out of Black Panther the way they notice Thor: Ragnarok is so funny.
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,418,It is black excellence exemplified that will leave audiences yearning to inhabit Wakanda forever.
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,419,"Black Panther is a hit! It's emotional, powerful and action packed to satisfy comic book fans as well as newcomers who probably haven't seen a Marvel film, but want to experience seeing Black excellence on the big screen."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,420,"This is a superhero movie for the ages, and especially for this age."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,421,"Inspiring and empowering in equal measure, Black Panther is a richer & deeper experience than most comic book fare."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,422,"He is just getting better and better and knows how to develop characters in this emotional way that you're invested...this guy is a rising star. As great as every single actor is in this movie, Ryan Coogler, once again, is the star of this film."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,423,"Part spy thriller, part all-out battle and part social commentary, ""Black Panther"" is consistently propelled by tonal and thematic flourishes that break with the conventions that have defined the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,424,"The incredibly stellar cast is led by a majestic Chadwick Boseman, reprising the role of T'Challa and finding him at a cross-roads in his life."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,425,"Yet it's The Walking Dead's Gurira who steals the show as the ferocious Okoye, gloriously swinging her spear in a billowing red gown."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,426,"Black Panther is every bit as good as you were hoping. Actually -- it's better. A terrific screenplay from Ryan Coogler and Joe Robert Cole elevates this thing way beyond the usual boundaries of the Marvel Universe."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,427,"Once ""Black Panther"" gets out of its crouching position and goes on a sprint, it's an engaging ride that rarely lets up."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,428,"You believe in T'Challa, you believe in Wakanda, and you believe - maybe for the first time - that the MCU actually matters."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,429,"It's easy to lament how long it took to bring Black Panther to the big screen. But at least the wait was worth it."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,430,"Like ""Wonder Woman"" last year, ""Black Panther"" is a project that fans have been waiting decades to see. And just like ""Wonder Woman,"" it was worth the wait."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,431,"Production design, costumes, and of course, visual effects are all on point, and newly minted Oscar-nominee Rachel Morrison shoots every frame to embrace the sumptuous detail."

BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,435,"The initial Twitter responses hailing it as a ""masterpiece"" go way overboard... [but Coogler] assembled one of the finest acting lineups ever recruited for a Marvel movie--or any genre outing, for that matter."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,436,"Black Panther perfects what the Marvel Cinematic Universe has always done so well: build a world so richly rendered, it's almost a letdown to reach the end of the film and realize it's time to return to our own reality."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,437,"Black Panther isn't just levelling out representation in Hollywood, it's inspiring the next generation of real-life heroes, and that's what makes this film truly magnificent."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,438,Black Panther has surpassed Iron Man as the best film of the MCU.
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,439,"You can see [Michael B.] Jordan offhandedly weighing the line in his mind like a rock he's about to lob: it's one of many nicely judged moments of performance here from a wildly appealing ensemble cast without a weak link."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,440,"Not only does it live up to the expected levels of epic exhilaration, it surpasses them, digging its claws into real-world social and political profundity."

BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,442,"When ""Black Panther"" works, it's thrillingly alive."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,443,"The director Ryan Coogler and a charismatic cast... turn racial clichés on their head and drag in some heavy Shakespearean conflict to create a vivid yarn that's entirely new, frequently startling and, at every step along the way, all Marvel."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,444,"We didn't know we'd been yearning for it until it arrived, but now that it's here it's unmistakable that the wait for a film like ""Black Panther"" has been way longer than it should have been."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,445,The Black Panther is not only one of the most entertaining recent superhero films but has an intelligence and a political dimension that such inchoate offerings as Suicide Squad and Justice League completely lacked.
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,446,"Coogler has proven he can play in the big boys' house."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,447,Most big studio fantasies take you out for a joy ride only to hit the same exhausted story and franchise-expanding beats. Not this one.
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,448,"Ryan Coogler's Black Panther is one of the Marvel Cinematic Universe's most powerful, moving, and thematically resonant films to date. It's also one of its most uneven, when all is said and done."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,449,"While the themes are deep, Black Panther is at the same time a visual joy to behold, with confident quirkiness, insane action sequences and special effects, and the glorious reveal of Wakanda,"
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,450,"Coogler has taken every genre in which black characters are traditionally sidelined, and then, with considerable flair and boldness, he's combined those genres and put black characters right at their heart."
BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,451,"The intriguing thing about Black Panther is that it doesn't look like a superhero film - more a wide-eyed fantasy romance: exciting, subversive and funny."

BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,456,"Thank God for the women beside [Boseman], including his regal mother Ramonda (Angela Bassett), brainiac baby sister Shuri (Letitia Wright), and fearless warrior-protector Okoye (Danai Gurira). They're indomitable, and so gorgeously, vividly drawn."

BlackPanther,BlackPanther_rm,459,"Say this about Black Panther, which raises movie escapism very near the level of art: You've never seen anything like it in your life."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,0,"It is one of the best movies to ever come out of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, balancing engaging action set pieces and witty dialogue with intelligent character studies and ethical debates."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,1,"The fact that a Marvel movie dares to question the big, shiny spectacle that is its bread and butter - and acknowledge that untold thousands die in the name of entertainment - seems rather novel."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,2,"The motto of the directors, Anthony and Joe Russo, appears to be: If you can make it happen, do it. Don't hold back."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,3,"As they did in Winter Soldier, the Russos have achieved an uncommon balance of plot and action, humor and drama, all of it once again deeply grounded in character."

CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,11,"It's commendable for having the right balance of story, character, emotion, humor AND high-octane action. The fight scenes are well-choreographed that you can actually SEE the action despite the sheer number of people fighting."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,12,"So whose side am I on? #TeamCap or #TeamIronMan? Um, #TeamScarletWitch, OBVS. I was super stoked to see both her and Black Widow get as much screen time as they did."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,13,"Civil War is the best thing Marvel Studios has produced. Not only does it work well as the third act of the ballad of Steve and Bucky, but it sets up the future of the MCU brilliantly."

CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,16,"Even in films dealing with such dark subject matter, the MCU still manages to make to capture our hearts and make us laugh."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,17,"I found the tone refreshing, although some may be put off by all the chattiness and debate in a movie that is nearly two-and-a-half hours long."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,18,"Now we have Captain America: Civil War, a film in which every single character decision is deeply personal, deeply emotional."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,19,"(It) never felt beholden to ""world building"" of establishing the many films that will be following; however, it did feel richly constructed upon the many films made prior."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,20,"Overall, Civil War is the most adult and realized film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and it comes highly recommended."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,21,DC Comics should be worried because Civil War has definitely set the bar high and comic book fans across the world will not be disappointed.
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,22,"Yeah, 'Captain America: Civil War' is true to its frenetic form as revved up entertainment preparing moviegoers for the upcoming summertime sizzle at the box office. After all, the on-screen Marvel Comics gravy train keeps moving merrily along"

CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,26,"The movie does wander off-topic just a bit at moments, but for the most part, this is a superhero epic with something real on its mind and the chops to present it well."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,27,"Civil War is an assured, confident conclusion to a trilogy that builds organically upon its established elements."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,28,"It manages to capture the super hero team as its only ever been done in animated series. It's next to impossible to get this kind of emotional connectedness in a few hours."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,29,"This is Marvel Studio's best film to date bar none."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,30,"At least these superfriends can still crack a joke (I've never been more grateful for Anthony Mackie's light touch) and, for all its seriousness, Civil War sustains a much-needed sense of humor."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,31,"Most of the film's pleasures come from dorky pipsqueak Tom Holland taking up the mantle of Spider-Man and joining the fight between Avengers factions."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,32,"With swift pacing, a generally well-rounded story, and fantastic action sequences, ""Civil War"" is not to be missed."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,33,"This is one for the whole family, and even worth the extra investment to see it in IMAX 3D... And while you might find some of the scenes a bit stretched out (the film is almost two-and-a-half-hours long), you'll certainly get your money's worth."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,34,"Overall, the lack of ingenuity makes for a lackluster story in need of major content editing."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,35,"The film is actually quite funny (tons of inside jokes for the comic book devotees) charming and heartfelt in many places. The other places, well, mega destruction and over-the-top action rules."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,36,"Captain America: Civil War focuses on the approach of superheroes to what's right and what's wrong. This movie makes you pick a side because both have very valid points."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,37,"At the heart of Captain America: Civil War is an amazing shape-shifting ability. It is a film that confronts the consequences of super-heroic intervention, while also providing a popcorn-worthy bang-pow experience."

CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,41,"There are a lot of players in this film but it never really feels like it's too crowded. It's just crowded enough to be an enjoyable film."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,42,"While it's immensely entertaining and has a biting sense of humor to boot, the film feels more like an Avengers series film than a stand-alone Cap pic."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,43,"Captain America: Civil War is very much a sequel to Winter Soldier but, regrettably, too long, tryingly complicated and it takes the best part of 75 minutes before it breaks into anything resembling comic exuberance."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,44,"Good luck picking a favorite fight, because every action scene is incredible."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,45,Only the Russo brothers have knocked it out of the park twice. This is the film with everything.

CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,50,"It's the balance of conflict at its core, and the film's willingness to expose and explore the deep-rooted feelings of its characters that makes Captain America: Civil War such a success."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,51,"In many ways, Civil War is Marvel's darkest and heaviest movie to date, but that's part of what makes it the studio's best."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,52,This is one of the best films Marvel have produced.
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,53,An interesting ending to the Steve Rogers saga and a promising start to the third stage of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. [Full review in Spanish]
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,54,Captain America: Civil War proves that Marvel knows how to lay down a stunning foundation in order to detail an epic saga.
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,55,"Coming out a month after the miserable bomb that was Batman V Superman has only helped to make Marvel's latest entry into the Avengers franchise look like a damn classic in comparison."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,56,"With some incredibly innovative action, some deeper, thought-provoking themes, and a plethora of dynamic characters, both old and new, Captain America: Civil War is among the very best of the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,57,"Captain America: Civil War turns The Avengers inside out, forcing conflict between the characters while managing to stage big action set pieces and even bigger jokes."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,58,"It's nearly a perfect comic book film."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,59,The good news about Civil War is that those willing to bone up on the backstory will find characters they actually care about enough to root for.
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,60,Captain America: Civil War is without a doubt my new favorite superhero movie.
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,61,"When the big battle between two feuding factions of the Avengers finally happens, it's a doozy."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,62,"Never mind if his stuff is cut with unbelievable dross, if the acting is terrible, the costumes are hideous, if the wigs are preposterous and the codpieces are disappointingly flat, loyal fans will still come back to be expertly fleeced."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,63,"... this is exactly what we asked for since (Steve) and Tony squared off in The Avengers... but it is also not what we wanted - and that's a good thing."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,64,"[While] the Russo brothers in the directors chair show a fairly deft hand at balancing a dozen characters and keeping the action exciting, elsewhere there's a bit of flailing."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,65,A perfectly fine brand deposit in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,66,"If we don't have something quite as fun and thrilling as The Avengers, we're still a hell of a long way from Zack Snyder's regrettable, murky Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice fiasco."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,67,"Thanks to its unpredictable story and avoidance of bombastic supervillain showdowns, Civil War stands out from Marvel's fun but formulaic back-catalog."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,68,"Joe and Anthony Russo (who directed the earlier Captain America: Winter Soldier, which introduced even more story threads picked up in this film's dense plot weave) are actually quite adept at this kind of big team juggling."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,69,"Its many ideas, plot-points and characters are expertly conceived, written and portrayed to make for a roller coaster of a superhero movie."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,70,"A tour de force in action and intrigue, Captain America: Civil War has raised the bar when it comes to what a Marvel movie can achieve."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,71,"Captain America: Civil War may seem like just another action-packed Marvel outing on the surface, but delving a little deeper, we find a fascinating entry to the series that allows us to explore these characters from an alternate angle than usual."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,72,"Captain America: Civil War is fun; it's too well made, acted and scripted for it to be anything less."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,73,"The real key to Captain America: Civil War is its sense of inevitability, and its acceptance that sometimes things change-they change big."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,74,"Despite the name on the marquee and the content of the advertising campaign, this is very much a film about Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.)."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,75,"Captain America: Civil War is good, but too stuffed to be great."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,76,"Civil War is the Marvel machine doing things right, but the machine is still designed to make films with all of the corners rounded off and all of the themes simplistic enough for ten-year-olds."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,77,"Recalls last year's extravaganza ""Avengers: Age of Ultron,"" although it's less slick and has a stronger emotional center."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,78,"It's this light-heartedness that keeps Captain America: Civil War from succumbing to the kind of pretentiousness that marred Batman V. Superman."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,79,"The most mature, smart and fun Marvel movie. [Full review in Spanish]"
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,80,"Marvel's response to superhero fatigue, then, is clear: Double-down on character and up the storytelling's short game as well as its long game. It's an old-fashioned strategy, and it absolutely works."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,81,"Marvel, with its comic strip cool, Industrial Light & Magic control of gravity, what may be the largest ensemble of characters in its movie history and visual artistry, has done it again."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,82,"It wields an equally large cast with surprising dexterity, never losing sight of which players matter most to the story it's trying to tell."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,83,"Joe and Anthony Russo effectively hit the pause button on the Avengers franchise to address the human cost of ""collateral damage,"" while still delivering the impressive action we've come to expect from the Marvel franchise."

CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,85,"It's more of the same, of course it has a little more entertainment, but it's the same tendency to repeat what has worked in the past, nothing new. [Full review in Spanish]"
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,86,"This satisfying adventure is rich with the things Marvel comics always did best: critiquing the consequences of power in explosive, four-color form."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,87,"Like guest star Ant-Man in his new Giant-Man identity, this somewhat ungainly Marvel sequel almost collapses under its own weight."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,88,"In Captain America: Civil War, the intelligent plotting, thoughtful character development and blockbuster action of the past two instalments comes to a thrilling apex."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,89,"Anthony and Joe Russo's first-rate feature provides both invigorating action and genuine contemplation. It's an engaging superhero movie that actually ponders the human cost of doing all that cool stuff."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,90,"On par with the recent Avengers combo films, but quite inferior to the prior Captain America outing."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,91,"Very entertaining, and a far tighter production than much of Marvel's recent output."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,92,"Not the best Marvel movie, but does do the best job balancing its obligations, while also boasting the series' best action sequence (Splice Today)"
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,93,"A good, disposable piece of FX-driven entertainment, even if it comes with the obligatory one-act storyline, lack of originality and 30-minute over-run."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,94,"Anthony and Joe Russo make a cheerful show of it, giving their gee-whiz comic book audience all they could wish for -- and more. But that's the problem -- it's still just 90 minutes worth of story stretched out to two-and-a-half hours."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,95,"It's this levity that makes the much-touted battle royale between Team Cap and Team Iron Man so much fun."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,96,"Hey, two superheroes can do battle without totally sucking."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,97,"The fact that Civil War ponders the importance of those who've died in conflicts doesn't add complexity to the film, it just fills it with hipocrisy. [Full review in Spanish]"
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,98,"SO entertaining it wll feel short, even if it's two and a half hours. I wanted more. Please give us more! [Full review in Spanish]"
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,99,"Captain America and Iron Man almost represent the schism that now divides American voters, politicians, and pundits. I say ""almost,"" because the film...doesn't inspire reflection upon the dire seriousness of our current ideological civil war."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,100,"When I saw that this was going to be a clash of superheroes, with former friends fighting each other, I wondered how they were going to set it up. Very carefully, it turns out, with a solid screenplay and strong performances."

CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,103,"(Visually), the Russos aim for clarity and hit the bullseye. And more importantly, they'll satisfy a core audience of fan-types that can be, shall we say, high-maintenance."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,104,"""Civil War"" invites too many people to the party and is a little too beholden to other once-and-future movies to match the excellence of its predecessors."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,105,http://www.spiritualityandpractice.com/films/reviews/view/28172/captain-america-civil-war
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,106,"Captain America and Iron Man have always had a humorously antagonistic relationship, with the former's red-white-and-blue purity conflicting with the latter's narcissistic vulgarity, so watching them truly at odds with each other packs a punch"
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,107,Marvel has defied expectations yet again with this action-packed but thought-provoking entry that masterfully introduces Tom Holland as the next Spider-Man.
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,108,"A barely adequate, tonally berserk lyric to the pains of franchise building. In other words, it does absurdly little with a whole lot."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,109,An underwhelming exercise in sound and fury striclty for brains on pause. .
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,110,"The fun and excitement of Captain America: Civil War carries it through a slow start and weak premise. It sets up great expectations for new chapters, and after this epic fracturing of their Avengers friendship, we want to know where they go from here."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,111,"Dull, overlong, exhausting and mildly entertaining without rising to the heights of the first Captain America's palpable thrills, suspense and intrigue"
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,112,"Cap has not just saved the world, he's saved a comic book universe from complacency by boldly raising the ante on all who dare follow this wonderful, magnificent entertainment."

CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,117,"Captain America: Civil War is the movie equivalent of the all-dressed potato chip: A junk food classic that can't be denied, but can never truly satisfy our desire for something original."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,118,"Above all, it's simply a well-made movie: juggling a staggering number of characters with absolute effortlessness and readily expanding Marvel's collection of heroes without cramming them in."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,119,"Captain America: Civil War is precisely crafted as one of the best comic book films of all time. It's as if Return of the Jedi stole all of the action sequences from Die Hard: With a Vengeance and Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,120,Captain America: Civil War is a great superhero blockbuster that lays the groundwork for even bigger and better things to come in Phase 3 of the MCU.

CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,127,"Buckle in. The ultimate battle of superhero titans is about to take off in Marvel's Captain America: Civil War and hold onto your seats, folks, because this is one helluva ride - and the best Marvel movie to date."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,128,"Chris Evans, with his pumped-up muscles and thawed-out all-American good looks, adds greatly to making this a satisfying watch."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,129,"Massive, overstuffed, overlong and yet fleet-footed, witty and terrifically entertaining."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,130,"Slid off my senses like Thor's hammer across Cap's vibranium shield -- the powerhouse hits land without so much as a scratch."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,131,"The sad middle-aged dudes who cling so desperately to these films require constant reassurances that they're not just fun stories for children in which men wear tights."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,132,Listening to the applause of cheers for deaths and devastation was a bit scary and more and more what we are seeing in real life. No wonder why!

CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,135,"Civil War's conflict is earned rather than contrived. It's the culmination of tense friendships and strained egos that Marvel has cultivated for years. The stakes feel real, which gives this comic book spectacle more heft than the genre usually deserves."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,136,"The balance that Captain America: Civil War strikes between action, character, emotion, humor, and intellectual debate makes this a compendium of all the best things the Marvel movies have had to offer."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,137,"It isn't a perfect effort, but it's plenty to reach summer blockbuster status, and Civil War will leave fans salivating for the next installment in the series."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,138,Not as bad as Batman v. Superman. But way too long and dumb. Who believes they are out to kill one another?
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,139,"This movie feels like the fanboy event we've been sold before that wasn't delivered, epically constructed and briskly paced."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,140,"Intense, entertaining adventure is a great threequel."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,141,"""...for me to consider  Captain America: Civil War a good movie - good enough to make me forget Prince had just died - it must be pretty good indeed."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,142,"...while one of the story lines does pick up from Captain America: The Winter Soldier, it's Iron Man who steals the show."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,143,"Damned if it isn't fun to watch Spider-Man pull off a Johnny Lawrence-approved leg sweep of Captain America."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,144,"Civil War is a shiny, inoffensive product meant to make millions for Disney on a global scale. It also delivers more pure entertainment than any film in recent memory."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,145,"A big, sprawling superhero mega-movie, with more spandex to the gallon than any flick that's come down the pike in a long time."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,146,"...make no mistake, this movie plays like a third ""Avengers"" film hidden within the thin, sub-hero veneer."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,147,"Scads of characters, oodles of travel, acres of eye-punishing shakey-cam action - the movie's excess of just about everything overwhelms its virtues."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,148,The Russos devote substantial time undoing the incoherent mess Joss Whedon left behind in AGE OF ULTRON...
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,149,"A non-stop action movie, but they can't stop the deeper, more interesting film emerging."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,150,"As long as talented, passionate filmmakers continue to be brought aboard to take these stories and characters in fresh directions, there is no reason to expect this massive franchise will grow stale or lose its vitality anytime soon."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,151,"This is a stark example of what movies have become, which is intellectual diarrhea...there is no acting...just one ridiculous fight after another between and among people who are more or less invulnerable. But, get used to it. This junk makes money."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,152,"Civil War is much better than Age of Ultron, but as a sequel of The Winter Soldier it falls short. [Full review in Spanish]"
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,153,"There remains a lot to like about it, such as an opening battle offering some sparkling 3-D effects, the thrilling final showdown, and its showcase cast."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,154,"...just another loud, overblown Marvel misfire..."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,155,"In the end this is a movie about friendships and conflict, and what can happen when the latter overwhelms the former. It's about two genuine heroes who can't reconcile their obligations and duties with the friendship they both cherish."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,156,"If there's something that we need to mention above civil war's perfect technical execution and rollercoster rythym, it's the way the characters connect with the audience after many years of exploring them. [Full review in Spanish]"
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,157,"The ""civil war"" that erupts among Avengers foments filmmaking invention, not anarchy. It harks back to a comic-book tradition that predates the Avengers."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,158,"The good news about the latest Marvel project to land on the screen is that it's livelier and more entertaining than the other Avenger offerings -- even if this one technically waves the Captain America banner."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,159,Civil War makes a pretense of pondering the consequences of going rogue. But Marvel is all about playing it safe.
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,160,"Downey Jr. persists in trying to give a real performance in these Marvel movies, and, against all odds, succeeds."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,161,"The super-charged 'Captain America: Civil War' is a winner."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,162,"Dependable, reliable, comforting - like ordering at a chain restaurant. You know what kind of meal you're going to get every time, and you'll most likely enjoy it."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,163,Highly entertaining.
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,164,"Splitsville followed by biffo, all with an extremely agreeable light touch."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,165,"My biggest complaint --- and one I'm weary of repeating --- is the habit of such films to include massive carnage by bombings, guns, car chases, etc. ""Captain America: Civil War"" would have been every bit as entertaining without this excessive violence."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,166,"""Captain America: Civil War"" has some surprises, but the battle scenes --- here we go again --- are far too long."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,167,"The action-packed and daring Captain America: Civil War is the most game-changing chapter in the Marvel Cinematic Universe since -- well, since Captain America: The Winter Soldier."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,168,"It's sure to please those who beat up on Batman v. Superman because it mixes lots of quips in with the action, the moralizing, and the tragic revelations."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,169,"An impressive achievement, though not an especially interesting one."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,170,"There is darkness, there is depth, but the important thing is that the element of fun is also most definitely present."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,171,"Marvel proves yet again that it's not just running on a streak of luck: These guys have enough superhero tricks up their sleeve to keep us coming back for the foreseeable future."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,172,A blockbuster among blockbusters.
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,173,"CA:CV moves along at a brisk pace, the effects are fantastic and the superhero line-up is the best we have seen since Avengers Assemble. Bottom line, CA:CV is an entertaining film with some great action sequences."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,174,"Simply put, when it comes to juggling multiple superheroes in a single movie, Marvel's latest comes close to setting the standard. And the studio, as well as the villagers, should have cause to rejoice."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,175,"As overwhelming as all this seems, the story stays incredibly focused on what defines Steve Rogers..."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,176,"Mostly, this one registers as sound and fury, signifying sequels."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,177,"Holland's webslinger is easily Civil War's best surprise. He projects a genuine sense of awe and wonder in the presence of the other heroes."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,178,"It takes a while to get going, but once it does, it's a blast."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,179,"Captain America: Civil War may look as if it's made from and operate as if it's beholden to the mold of the regular, old superhero movie, but it doesn't feel that way."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,180,"The filmmakers ... understand that they've built up a vast ensemble of character types, all of them played by better-than-average actors, and that they can mix and match the drama, comedy, or action as they see fit."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,181,"""Captain America: Civil War"" is for every little kid who ever bashed one action figure into another while saying ""Pew! P-Pew! Kapow-shuh-WOOOOSH!!"" In other words, it's nearly perfect."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,182,"A comic book extravaganza that's enhanced by wit and audacity, not to mention the sort of action that only mountains of money can buy."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,183,"There's a lot wrong in the film's two and a half hours, but enough that's right to keep the train from falling off the tracks."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,184,"After the first two ""Captain America"" entries, the finest comic-book movies of the last five years, this one is disappointing."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,185,"The biggest of all the Avengers films, and perhaps the most satisfying."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,186,"Big, Bigger and Biggest doesn't equal Best in this Captain America chapter of the Avengers movie chronicle."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,187,"Humor becomes a resource that saves the film. But even when that, the superhero formula is starting to feel old. [Full review in Spanish]"
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,188,...works better as big group caper film than action extravaganza.
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,189,"Heroes fighting each other over a misunderstanding or ideological conflict is a longtime comic book staple. Batman v Superman is a great example of the exact wrong way to present this sort of conflict. ""Civil War"" nails it."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,190,"Civil War hinges on a public outcry for accountability and oversight. Which sounds about as sexy as the minutes from a zoning meeting, but in practice makes for a toothsome debate"
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,191,"The players salvage this thing with their acting and awesome thighs, and the fun really kicks in when Spider-Man (Tom Holland), Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), and Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) join the squabble in an exhilarating airport sequence."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,192,"It's not a great superhero fantasy but it's a good one -- genuine fun, thank heaven."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,193,"How the emotional dynamics of the schism impacts the characters is what elevates ""Civil War."" These are friends and comrades forced to fight for their beliefs. Each blow they inflict on each other is as painful to them as it is to their opponent."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,194,"Civil War feels like just another overstuffed Marvel movie working itself through a brand strategy checklist. Plenty will he happy with that. And yes, it's rather more fun than the last time a couple of superheroes went at it on the big screen."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,195,This is one of the best movies Marvel has created.
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,196,Delivers an epic adventure that finds its greatest power by scaling back the superhero antics to reveal the human combatants at their core.
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,197,"While this is one of the better Marvel efforts, Marvel and others are creating serious Super Hero fatigue. How many times can we see the same basic themes writ large?"
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,198,"""Captain America: Civil War"" does not in any way transcend the conventions of the genre. On the contrary: It succeeds because it doesn't really try."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,199,"It's a far cry from the grim, feigned gravitas of the Snyderverse. For those who relish the sprawl of the Marvel Comics universe, ""Civil War"" should be a delight."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,200,"[It] leaves plenty of ""Yeah, but what about ..."" questions unanswered. But the studio also delivers a few things better than ever here. Order the free-refill tub for what may be the popcorniest ride of the summer movie season."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,201,"Has nearly all the strengths of the best Marvel Cinematic Universe movies so far, as well as some of the weaknesses."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,202,"Much of ""Captain America: Civil War"" is just the laborious working-out of leftover dangling plot elements from ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" two summers ago."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,203,"""Civil War"" gets right almost everything that the dull, serious and chaotic ""Batman vs. Superman"" got wrong."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,204,"Civil War is of course a huge payoff for fans who've been following from the start, but even the casual movie-goers will pick up on the fact that there's something slightly more special about this one."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,205,"Captain America: Civil War is a comic book pulped into today's newspaper."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,206,"I appreciated Civil War for not only some great action scenes, but also for delving into more internal issues with our heroes, allowing us to see them from an alternate angle than what we're used to."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,207,"To the short list of superhero flicks that exceed expectations, add ""Captain America: Civil War."""
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,208,Arguably the movie that the previous 12 Marvel adventures have all been working towards
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,209,Lower your expectations and enjoy the CGI ride with characters who can do no cinematic wrong.
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,210,"It's wildly entertaining, emotionally moving at times, humorous, intense, and just plain fun."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,211,The Russos continue to prove themselves as fantastic filmmakers especially when it comes to action movies.
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,212,Captain America: Civil War is the Avengers movie that Age of Ultron aspired to be.

CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,214,"Plays out just like any grand superhero epic should, with plenty of edge of your seat action, thrills, comedy and more.(Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Profanity etc. - Also Available)"
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,215,"""Captain America: Civil War"" appeals to me more strongly than any superhero movie of the last decade."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,216,"A little too rambling at two and a half hours, but otherwise just the right shade of light and bright for a movie about superheroes fighting superheroes."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,217,"There are about ten movies going on in ""Captain America: Civil War,"" which is at least seven too many. The good news is, most of them are fun, and there are enough rousing moments to elevate the movie to Marvel's top tier."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,218,"Who emerges as the winner of this ""Civil War""? The audience. The picture delivers in a big, big way."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,219,"If you live and breathe Marvel, this is one of the MCU's stronger offerings. If you are a spy coming in from the cold, the answer is not so clear."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,220,"After the formulaic thrills of The Winter Soldier and Age of Ultron, Marvel's Avengers were in danger of getting stuck in a rut, but a smart script for this surprisingly focussed thriller kicks everything into a new direction."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,221,"The filmmakers clearly understand the unique strengths and weaknesses of the various heroes, and they depict them smartly and distinctly over the course of the fight."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,222,"Marvel employs its superpowers to ensure Captain America: Civil War is nothing like the underwhelming Batman v Superman. A deft touch, perfect casting and well-paced script does it."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,223,"Despite its technical polish, it comes across more as just another assembly-line commercial product than the special event that fans are no doubt hoping for."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,224,Superhero-on-superhero collisions beyond the dreams of fanboy heaven.
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,225,"Suffice it to say that, rather than psychic powers or super-strength, casting has always been the Marvel movies' secret weapon. That holds true here, up to and including charismatic newcomers Chadwick Boseman [and] Tom Holland."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,226,"New challenges, darker reflections, stranger characters, and enough dramatic lubrication to feed additional sequels and spin-offs, adding more width to this already gloriously widescreen world."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,227,The Captain America series are the most consistent and satisfying films that Marvel have made. And Civil War is the best one yet.
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,228,The movie fumbles the question at the very heart of the Avengers but not before giving its fan base plenty of reasons to cheer.
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,229,"There are acknowledged costs to the movie's confrontations, from the bruises that almost every character sports to the bystanders who are killed in the crossfire."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,230,"Toss in a few secrets revealed and Captain America: Civil War kicks off the summer movie season with a punch strong enough to make the Hulk's head spin."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,231,"Fun, happily, is one of the many ingredients in copious supply here. When you include Paul Rudd as Ant-Man, how could it not be? Then again, there isn't a lot of room for him, so he's kind of wedged in there, but it's pretty swell when he's around."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,232,"With every new installment of the comic book franchise, the scale gets bigger, relationships get trickier, new forces enter the fray."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,233,"With Civil War, Marvel Studios has proven, once again, that the world's heroes remain in good hands."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,234,"It probably doesn't need to run two and a half hours long, but at least it's a case of too much of a good thing."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,235,"Where Batman v Superman tossed out ideas without ever thinking them all the way through, Civil War is constantly aware of the consequences of its characters' actions, both to themselves and to the people around them."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,236,"In short, the movie has just about everything."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,237,"Even if it's a great movie for the genre, the movie is far from perfect. [Full review in Spanish]"
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,238,One of the best blockbusters ever made.
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,239,"It all escalates into a group showdown that's gloriously fun and genuinely sad, because if you've made it through eight years of Marvel features, you care about these quippy oddballs and their imperfect alliance."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,240,"Captain America: Civil War balances an over-loaded cast with ease, as this action-heavy new Marvel chapter will have viewers salivating over what comes next."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,241,"The film's real conflict is idealism versus realism... The actualization of that conflict gives the Russo brothers an anchor around which to stage half a dozen top-flight superhero battles."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,242,Civil War resonates not only with our current climate of hostile political divisions and questions about American intervention in foreign conflicts. It also carries echoes of American anxieties that stretch back to the beginning of the 20th century.
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,243,"As amiable as he is, Spidey's presence compromises the very stakes Civil War is trying to pitch."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,244,"A house divided against itself cannot stand. But in the case of Captain America: Civil War, a divided house brings out the best in this supersized superhero franchise."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,245,"It's fine. But these movies are like going back to a magic show where the illusionist dazzled you the first time or two, and realizing he's just going to keep doing the same tricks."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,246,Downey is enough to make you think that an Avengers movie with no action at all might still be good. It might even be an improvement.
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,247,"As far as big superhero mash-ups are concerned, this one whets the appetite without providing a satisfying main course."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,248,"Sure, it's too much and way too familiar. But Captain America: Civil War brings the fun, the fierce and the fireworks. Summer, we have liftoff."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,249,"A tremendous feat of filmmaking. It will leave you breathless. It will make you laugh constantly. It will make you cheer. It will make you think about the positions these characters take, and it may put you at odds with a hero you love."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,250,"There's a lot of something for everyone in this standardly super, superhero movie."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,251,"Despite a dense first half that might confound newcomers, it delivers all the humor and action that fans have come to expect -- as well as the finest Avengers fight scene yet."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,252,"It's just stultifyingly dutiful."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,253,"By this time one would think that the Marvel formula was getting old and that it wouldn't work anymore, and yet the studio just keeps making it better."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,254,Ponderous pandering. And no Paltrow as Pepper Potts?
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,255,Exceeds all expectations as this marvelous epic ensures every other summer blockbuster is vying for second best.
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,256,"It's simply just a story about the bonds of friendship, doing the right thing when presented with a difficult decision and how we're ultimately shaped by our choices."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,257,"A good amount of self-aware humor permeates the challenging two-hour, 26-minute running time of this movie."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,258,If you do not count Guardians of the Galaxy -- because it remains an eccentric outlier -- Civil War now easily ranks as the best movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,259,"Kudos to co-directors Anthony and Joe Russo and the team of writers for juggling more than a dozen comic-book characters and nearly that many plot lines, and only occasionally getting us (and by us I mean ME) lost in the Geek Weeds."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,260,"Nothing in Civil War takes your breath away... Little in story terms is what you'd call daisy fresh. But almost everything in it works on its own prescribed terms, and the quiet moments register."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,261,"Civil War, at its best, is blessedly light on its superhero-booted feet."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,262,"Civil War lives in those moments when the smashing starts. The central fight between the two halves of the Avengers group is a tremendous sequence, full of imaginative teamwork and impressive effects."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,263,"It does prove, if Marvel hasn't already, that something can be both a load-bearing act of brand extension and a nimble, colorful blast of entertainment."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,264,"Their respective motivations are convincing, and the 16-minute ""splash panel"" showdown at the Leipzeig airport is fun."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,265,"In a time when superheros have proven to be complex and able to star in dramas, it feels like a letdown to see them reduced to quips and jokes. [Full review in Spanish]"
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,266,"In the race with DC Comics, Marvel still comes out on top when it comes to fun."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,267,"It's a rollicking and action-packed extravaganza in which every superhero has a moment to shine."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,268,"The Russos understand how to pace action better than many of their MCU contemporaries, and as such, Civil War moves at a rapid clip despite all the table-setting and it being the lengthiest Marvel film to date at 146 minutes"
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,269,"Naturally this is all cluttered and overstuffed to the point of bursting, and yet the convoluted feel and overfamiliarity of much of the plotting is compensated for by the Russo brothers knack for gargantuan action, some tough laughs and real acting."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,270,"It's the most lively, engaging Marvel movie since Guardians of the Galaxy, and among the very best of the whole Avengers series."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,271,The undeniable fun of the action scenes only exacerbates the failure of the narrative to adequately contend with its own themes.
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,272,The latest Captain America adventure us nothing more than a really long trailer for the new adventures of the new Spider-Man. [Full review in Spanish]
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,273,"While it lacks the sense of surprise of [the last film], its mix of action, humor, effects, the introduction of a new character and the reintroduction of an old one strikes just the right tone for a film that is as much about marketing as moviemaking."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,274,"The summer movie season has barely begun, and already the remedy for superhero film fatigue has arrived."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,275,"A taut, sinewy piece of filmmaking with enough brains to keep you engaged and enough brawn to keep you in awe."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,276,"The third ""Captain America"" film entertains relentlessly, which is to say loudly and busily, but with enough humor and intelligence to make it seem less pandering than it actually is."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,277,"Captain America v Iron Man succeeds where Batman v Superman utterly failed. Civil War is Marvel's greatest action film so far."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,278,The Marvel blockbuster machine keeps on trucking with a double-sized new issue of Captain America that packs enough punch to distract from its grinding plot mechanics.
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,279,"Marvel has no peer in this arena, and the utter perfect and sheer awesomeness of ""Captain America: Civil War"" is the best example of their superiority."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,280,"Civil War is both a Captain America sequel and a third Avengers movie, and that's more than any movie could possibly pull off. It does the best it can, though."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,281,"Bragging just a bit - see how many franchise characters we've got, DC? - Marvel practically doubles the number of superheroes for this movie. And it's too much."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,282,"A direct sequel to Captain America: The Winter Soldier...a crazy-cool superhero teamup/smackdown movie to make Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice look like a tea party, and a franchise-launching introduction to the new Spider-Man..."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,283,"Marvel makes it funny, and that charm and care is what has and will keep audiences coming back over and over again."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,284,"Just another entry to the superhero genre, they tried to make it ""the"" definitive film for it but it falls short, however, that doesn't mean this is a bad film at all. [Full review in Spanish]"

CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,291,"Civil War has all the trappings to sway your experience and make you feel like you've watched the best superhero movie of your life."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,292,"It's worth seeing alone for the ultimate superhero face-off battle scene - epic stuff."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,293,"There's a light touch, and it is often funny. There are many series in-jokes -- the scene where Iron Man recruits Spider-Man (Tom Holland) is a classic example. And the action scenes are outstanding."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,294,The two sides arrive on the tarmac of Leipzig airport... [and] the result manages to resemble both a brawl in a Magaluf nightclub and one of the most purely delirious scenes in recent action cinema.
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,295,"A near perfect Superhero film! All that destruction in the previous films have real world consequences and those chickens come home to roost. There's no hugging it out this time."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,296,"There's some good stuff in 'Captain America: Civil War.' That's what these Marvel things are now: a lot of stuff."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,297,"If you're a fan of the previous Marvel films, then this film is pretty much just more of what you already like, with all the Marvel-spectacle you could ever hope for."

CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,299,The best way to think of Captain America: Civil War is as a toy box in which the sheer quantity of toys partly makes up for the lack of anything new.
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,300,"There are more characters and subplots that a Game of Thrones episode but somehow, directors Anthony and Joe Russo have managed to mash it all together into something that works."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,301,"A remarkably coherent and tightly focused affair that by virtue of clarity and concision, manages to keep all its ducks in a row while providing both the movies billed, i.e. the sequel to Winter Soldier and the Avengers' civil war."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,302,"This film may excel at building anticipation for cool things coming a year or two down the line, but does a movie called Captain America that leaves you wishing you were watching one called Spider-Man really count as a win for blockbuster fans?"
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,303,"The central debate is topical but it cries out for input from some of Marvel's newer creations (if only there was space for Ms Marvel, aka Kamala Khan, a Pakistani-American teen from New Jersey)."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,304,"Even for those of us who aren't comic-book devotees, Captain America: Civil War scores as pure cinematic escapism."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,305,"The picture's great achievement is the adept balancing of so many characters. It never feels overstuffed and everyone has their moment and purpose while several new heroes are introduced."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,306,"In many respects this is the Marvel movies' finest hour."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,307,The sheer force of so much superpowered personality on screen makes for a blast of a movie.
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,308,"A near-perfect blend of humour, drama and action."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,309,"There are lots of other laugh-out-loud moments: self-aware, comic book-aware ones for Marvel fans and straight-out ones for non-expert viewers."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,310,"Captain America: Civil War is very good, but the connective tissue between the powerful scenes, felt like chewy gristle in a great cut of steak."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,311,"The Russos have taken a leaf out of Joss Whedon's playbook, remembering that as cool as they are in costume, the most character development happens when these superheroes are in civvies."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,312,"Captain America: Civil War rumbles busily towards a confrontation between Cap and Iron Man, but that fistfight is perhaps the least interesting bit of this frenetic, hyperactive and intermittently enjoyable film."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,313,"Tough, unanswerable human questions frame spectacular, innovative action sequences that are like superhero ballets. This series just keeps getting better."

CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,325,"Not only does Civil War eschew the dull trend of city-wide destruction, it bases its entire plot on the consequences of having caused all that ruin."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,326,"Marvel returns with their biggest blockbuster ever, proving how well they know how to deliver a product that audiences will love. [Full review in Spanish]"
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,327,"Look, I don't begrudge those who love the Avengers, as they so passionately do. I'm just genuinely perplexed."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,328,"It's not as gloomy as DC's recent efforts (few films are) and judicious doses of wit and charm relieve the angst and the smashing."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,329,"Civil War, for all of its fanboy shout-outs, continues The Winter Soldier's sense of mystery and intrigue, using the shady shenanigans to drive action sequences that rarely feel forced."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,330,"The political allegories are mostly abandoned and swapped for character motivation, as if we should never have bothered to contemplate a second meaning in the first place."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,331,"Marvel movies are not adapted from stories they're based on, they seem to be the product of dreams. [Full review in Spanish]"
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,332,"A mix of genres that appeals not just to comic book fans, but also to a broader audience looking for stories full of emotion and intrigue that are able to hold their own. [Full review in Spanish]"
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,333,"Funny, sad, satirical, spectacular... this is that rare blockbuster that proves that more can be more."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,334,"Grief, anguish, revenge. All of these, when rendered onto the canvas of a well-rounded character, are so much more potent than the sight of a city crashing into another city or a looming CGI spaceship drawing ever nearer to its fatal destination."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,335,One of the best superhero flicks until now. [Full review in Spanish]
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,336,Captain America: Civil War is therefore a stunning achievement: one that far exceeds expectations to deliver one of the most thrilling superhero experiences you are ever likely to see.
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,337,"These films no longer have to delight and surprise us; no, their job now is to manage the brand, not screw anything up too royally, and keep us hooked for the next installment. Civil War pulls all that off mostly well."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,338,"Iron Man and Captain America duke it out in a round, exciting film in what can be described as the biggest blockbuster of the year. [Full review in Spanish]"
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,339,"In spite of having so many characters on screen, the film never turns into Avengers 2.5 and always mantains focus on Captain America. It's not perfect, but it almost is and you will really enjoy it. [Full review in Spanish]"
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,340,No doubt this is the kind of high note Marvel would like to continue indefinitely across the franchise.
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,341,"Captain America: Civil War is overflowing with characters, taking old favourites, introducing new ones, and making them all work together in glorious harmony."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,342,"It's not just breathtaking in its visuals, it's heartbreaking in its content, making Captain America: Civil War one of the best Marvel movies yet."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,343,I feel sorry for DC fans.
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,344,"Revels in it's complacency, spectacular only within the boundaries of what has become the serviceable standard for a Marvel film; it's all glory and no guts."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,345,"Devotion among bros (debrotion?) is tested in Civil War, which sees suspicious boy scout Steve Rogers battle Tony Stark, in defence of his old Brooklyn buddy Bucky Barnes... [it's] unique; you don't often say that of 13th instalments."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,346,"Where we afraid we would get tired of superhero movies? if what's comes next is as good as this, send me all the movies you want. [Full review in Spanish]"
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,347,"There's enough variety in the action to sustain at least four major arrangements without resorting to more boom, smash and bam. For a two-and-a-half hour movie, everything's surprisingly well-paced."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,348,"This is how Marvel Entertainment does the multi-hero smackdown thing, and man, does it deliver."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,349,"This is good ridiculous fun, with a steady stream of wisecracks to accompany the fan-pleasing one-on-one match-ups."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,350,"Marvel movies don't get much better than this. The trouble is, they don't want to."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,351,A large demonstration that Marvel can go much further. [Full review in Spanish]
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,352,"...a bright, vivid, compelling cocktail..."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,353,It is during those scenes with Spider-Man that Marvel Studios demonstrates its greatest strength: a certainty of tone.
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,354,"Plotwise, there's a lot of ground to cover in Civil War (even at two-and-a-half hours). But the Russos juggle all of the murky motivations and shifting alliances with impressive deftness."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,355,"Captain America: Civil War, has managed to reinvent the comic book movie once again, creating a film that's thoughtful, mature and moving at the same time as being a thrilling ensemble romp."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,356,"Thanks to the extraordinary engineering work of screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely and directors Anthony and Joe Russo, this film keeps moving, never losing its sense of purpose."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,357,"In the 2016 battle for superhero supremacy, Marvel has unquestionably delivered the knock-out blow."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,358,"There is real maturity in a story of guilt, revenge, torn loyalties and tragic revelations - between the fights, explosions, chases and general awesomeness."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,359,"Heroes or vigilantes is the question raised in this highly inventive, full-throttle adventure... An agile mind is required to keep up with the never-ending plot twists and leaps; it is refreshing to find genuine originality and flair"
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,360,"Unlike Avengers: Age of Ultron, this is leaner and more low-key. Captain America: Civil War is less about citywide destruction or alien hordes being repelled than it is mistrust and internal divisions."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,361,"Not only is it another stellar Cap movie, it's maybe my favorite Tony Stark movie, and it also proves how you put a million heroes in the same movie effectively."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,362,"The Russos deliver the goods once again and prove to have a safe pair of hands when it comes to pacey, well-choreographed action and accommodating a large starry cast."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,363,"It's a magnificent action film, it's a wonderful character piece, it's big, brash, bursting with confidence and brio; it's Marvel firing on all cylinders just when, by rights, we might be expecting the law of diminishing returns to set in."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,364,"Once the plot kicks in, things chug along nicely, though action scenes are blighted by shaky camera syndrome."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,365,"The biggest, the boldest and the most ambitious movie yet to come from Marvel Studios."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,366,"The film's tone and themes feel a tiny bit darker and a lot more grown-up than usual, but the reaction it provokes is still one of giddy, childlike joy."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,367,"If Captain America: Civil War is the true herald of Marvel's Phrase Three and its carefully planned future; maybe it doesn't actually feel so bad that we'll be getting these movies every year until the Earth collapses in on itself."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,368,"The characters are multi-layered, crammed full of old allegiances and grudges and irritations. They have personalities. Remember those?"
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,369,"There are still imperfections to be found in this Marvel offering, but when the highs are this good, it's hard not to temporarily give in to our new insect overlords."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,370,"Packed to bursting with the one ingredient 'Batman v Superman' lacked: joy."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,371,"The pitch is simple enough - liberalism or totalitarianism, heroes or vigilantes - and there's more than a whiff of American imperialism on both sides of the coin."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,372,Puts a certain other superhero vs superhero movie to shame.
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,373,"Calling this 'the best Marvel movie' is equivalent to proclaiming 'this is the best Dorito I've ever tasted.'"
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,374,"This is the cinematic superhero showdown you've dreamt of since childhood, precisely because that's everything - and all - it wants to be."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,375,"It's a huge aspartame rush of a film: a giant irresistible snack, not nutritious, but very tasty."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,376,"This movie is so toothless that you'll probably pay for your ticket in a paper cup on the side of the road... it's so concerned with keeping everything in line for future movies that it ultimately takes no risks..."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,377,"In the best Comic Book film since The Dark Knight, the Russo Brothers along with Captain America and Iron Man completely knock it out of the park."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,378,"[T]he best Marvel yet, with the greatest superhero action on film. It's immense, marvelous action-packed fun... [T]he single greatest pure superhero movie ever made."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,379,The Russos deftly craft compelling blockbuster entertainment out of moral and emotional conflicts.
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,380,"While slightly overlong, this movie is bright, creative, insightful, affecting and, above all else, fun."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,381,"Tear away the powers, abilities and egos, though, and the third Captain America movie is at its core a deep exploration of friendship and family and what sacrifices should be made to hold onto both."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,382,"Civil War isn't great despite being the third Captain America and thirteenth overall Marvel movie - it's great because of those things."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,383,"Directors Anthony and Joe Russo continue to mine their experience with TV comedies, juggling all the members of their superhero family with a playful touch that both informs character interaction and delivers vital breathing room in between battles."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,384,"If there's a risk of the Marvel 'formula' becoming stale, there isn't any evidence of that here. Civil War isn't just a damn-near-perfect popcorn crowd-pleaser; it doesn't offer any easy answers for its combatants, or the world going forward."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,385,"Featuring what's arguably the best ever screen depiction of Spider-Man as well as a cool new hero in Black Panther, Captain America: Civil War can't quite recapture the emotional and cerebral strengths of its predecessor."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,386,"A gargantuan entertainment that finds room for a little emotional resonance underneath the sterling spectacle, ""Captain America: Civil War"" is a well-paced, thoroughly satisfying, completely overstuffed action-thriller."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,387,"'Captain America: Civil War' Is Great Fun, Even As It Alternates Between Shameless Fan Service Bits And Subversive Narrative Choices."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,388,"Matching its blockbuster scale and spectacle with the smarts of a great, grown-up thriller, Captain America: Civil War is Marvel Studios' finest film yet."
CivilWar,CivilWar_rm,389,"Call it ""civil war"" or call it brand extension; call it a ""cinematic universe"" or a corporate behemoth - the latest Marvel extravaganza furthers the studio's cross-pollination of action franchises in a way that's sure to satisfy devotees."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,0,"It is without question an important film today, and a quintessential product of the America we inhabit."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,1,A movie that beats you into submission and makes you wonder if the sun will ever come out again.
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,2,"Batman v Superman is a tiresome, ill-tempered film, and one too lazy even to earn its dismal outlook."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,3,"When in doubt, [Snyder] simply slings another ingredient into the mix, be it an irradiated monster, an explosion on government premises, or the sharp smack of masonry on skull."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,4,"If only the film actually had depth, along with a little levity to lighten the bulk in the script, the visual murk and the sonic overkill."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,5,"A ponderous, smothering, over-pixelated zeppelin crash of a movie scored by a choir that sounds like it's being drowned in lava."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,6,"Don't bother with this one. The acting is sub par & the CGI is hard to look at. Superman was the only saving grace but still not worth watching, unless you need help sleeping."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,7,"Wondering how to teach your offspring that the world is a horrifying, random, awful place? Let director Zack Snyder take care of that for you."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,8,"Lex Luthor's plan has so many plot holes as well as the script as a whole."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,9,"Dawn of Justice is perhaps not the Batman/Superman film we deserve, but it's the one we have right now. This chapter has just enough spark to light the universe fuse."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,10,Zack Snyder has directed both films and has successfully delivered a rich and cohesive cinematic world in which to set his growing cast of superheroes and villains.
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,11,Batman v Superman is a great film and a spectacle that marks a new era for superheroes. [Full Review in Spanish]
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,12,"One big, beautiful mess. This film is screaming with so much potential but, for the most part, it fails to capture that potential at every single turn."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,13,Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is dark and dour through and through.
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,14,"Director Zack Snyder and four screenwriters, including David S. Goyer, opt for a darker tone than audiences are accustomed to in Superman films. This time it works, however, with the inclusion of Batman giving it a grittier edge."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,15,"There's a whole subplot (...) about the world trying to decide how it feels about Superman (...) and it's so important that it's dropped about an hour into the movie."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,16,"...akin to a Philosophy 101 thesis read aloud while you're being punched repeatedly in the face."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,17,Snyder debe entender que algo oscuro no es precisamente realista.
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,18,"Where BvS largely succeeds as a visual feast of imagery and action spectacle, it fails in creating an emotional backdrop for its gods to resonate with us mortals."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,19,Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice suffers from being both highly derivative and uninspired at the same time
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,20,"Snyder's Superman is the most universally relatable version of the character yet and the social, political and cultural significance of BvS will be appreciated over time"
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,21,"BVS's most pivotal scene centers around a jar of urine. I'm not kidding."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,22,"""There's very little room to breathe in Synder's world, one that appears permanently stained with an oppressively ashen color palette."""
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,23,"Snyder's big-budgeted connect-the-dots comic book caper feel so incoherently stiff and aimless. Humorless and hackneyed, Batman v Superman: Dawn Of Justice will probably satisfy indiscriminate devoted fans that will buy into the proposed heralded rivalry"
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,24,"That $250 million of studio money was spent on making something so strange and incoherent is a rare achievement. It is not a good film by any means - but like a car crash unfolding before my very eyes, it proved impossible to look away."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,25,A mega-budgeted mess of a movie that betrays all the telltale signs of a studio at war with itself.
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,26,Zack Snyder ends decades of anticipation and finally brings both Batman and Superman together for the first time on the big screen with Batman V Superman: Dawn Of Justice.
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,27,"[An] ungainly, dreary, feature-length trailer for the DC Cinematic Universe that confuses quantity with quality and volume for depth."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,28,"It's difficult to not feel like a lot of ""Batman v Superman"" is an exhaustive - and expensive- effort from DC and Warner Bros. to catch up to Disney and Marvel's well-oiled cinematic universe."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,29,"As a comic book fan myself, ""Batman v Superman"" has its moments, but is underwhelming as a film and lacks any fully realized characters."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,30,An incoherent mess with unnecessary prolonged sequences that just extends the time limit
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,31,"BvS strains so hard for relevance that it forgets superheroes are to the adult world what Buffy was to high school: a series of choices and difficult events, elevated to a mythic level of high stakes."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,32,"The result of its prolonged and ridiculous premise, over-use of CGI and explosions and lack of any interesting characters? Boredom."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,33,"Say what you will about this cluttered, densely plotted do gooder yarn; it sure doesn't play like escapism."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,34,"If you like Batman v. Superman already, then you'll definitely enjoy the ultimate cut."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,35,A pretty hollow movie that wants to be more than just a superhero movie and showcase its characters because they are the most popular comic book characters of all time.
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,36,"The results are shocking, at times borderline sadistic but effective. Like the musical score, which resembles a chorus of anvils, Batman v Superman pummels the audience into submission."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,37,"WHen this movie is good, it is really, really good...but man, when it is not? Brace yourself. This movie suffers from fighting with itself for screen time."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,38,"It wants us to believe it's trafficking in topical notions of politics, religion, and moral ambiguity, but its main currency is our contemporary penchant for hip and affected pessimism."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,39,"It wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be, but it was pretty bad."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,40,"The movie is a colossal letdown on almost every front, but in some ways, it was to be expected considering the magnitude of what DC and Warner Bros. wanted to accomplish only two films into their shared universe"
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,41,"Zack Snyder is not a subtle director. An understatement, I know. But it's more obvious than ever here."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,42,"As the pair pound away at each other, it's the hapless viewer who's left begging for mercy, battered into submission by Snyder's overbearing direction and Hans Zimmer's bombastic score."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,43,"By the time Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice concludes, don't be surprised if you're cranky and exhausted from its hectic, tumultuous conclusion."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,44,"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is recommended only so you can end the almost three-year long wait to find out what happens in the epic collision, but unfortunately for nothing more than that."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,45,"It flits to and fro between them, often at dizzying speed, in a way that for a long time is quite enjoyable and yet always carried the danger that my head might explode. Batman... Superman... Batman... Superman... Lex Luthor!"
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,46,"Batman v Superman is not the franchise jump-starter anyone wanted. It's poison in the Justice League well."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,47,"Go for the Affleck, stay for the Gadot."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,48,"It's exactly what you're expecting, but longer, louder, and with an almost unfathomable amount of digitally created violence."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,49,"At two-and-a-half hours, the film features Wayne and Kent mostly glowering at each other at swanky high-rise parties as the rabble teems below."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,50,"Ultimately, Batman v. Superman is a film with no real reason for being, other than to usher in the next round of DC Universe films, and to provide a bunch of explosions."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,51,"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is such a bleak, disorienting and incoherent mess that despite the few promising moments that sporadically appear, it's nearly impossible to enjoy."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,52,"There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,53,"Batman Vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice is not so much a movie as it is an extended warning: You comic book movie fans better like this, because there's going to be a hell of a lot more where this came from."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,54,The script BvS is guaranteed to make people stop complaining about the sloppiness of the third act of Spectre.
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,55,"Snyder knows how to paint a picture but perhaps needs to stay away from the writing process. Watch the Ultimate Edition when you can, and see if it changes how you feel about the movie. It sure did me."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,56,It seems amazing that something as idiotic as Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice could now even get beyond the pitching stage.
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,57,"This film isn't as bad as the initial backlash would imply but nor is it anywhere near as good as its own hype promised."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,58,"Remember when comic book movies were fun? Well, you'll have to use your memory because there's not much fun to be found in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,59,"By the end of the film's near-unwatchable final battle, any hope of nuance or intentional subtext had been snuffed out by hours of ugly CGI and pulverized debris."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,60,"The movie is too long. Too much story contains too little humanity or drama. Too many things happen far too often for the really big things to register with an audience when they're filing out of the theater."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,61,"For all the film's noise, and thrumming violence, it's pretty hard to care very much about either principal hero."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,62,"As this uneven film grinds to an end, it sets itself up for more shenanigans in more episodes with more super heroes."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,63,"This Ultimate Edition is a bittersweet experience. It shows us how close we were to a good film, and how arbitrary things like this can sometimes become."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,64,"Snyder has brought a different edge to the superhero genre, one that questions what drives these men of steel and creatures of the night to do what they do and believe what they believe. There is something to admire in that."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,65,"While not the worst superhero comic book adventure ever to grace the multiplex, it's likely the most frustratingly disappointing."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,66,"Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice pits the two titans against each other with beautiful visuals, too many characters, and a borderline nonsensical plot."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,67,"This terrific transfer amplifies the film's impressive formal qualities."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,68,"The smartest thing about Zach Snyder's Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016) is its revisionist take on the destruction that concluded his Superman reboot Man of Steel."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,69,"The superhero world needed better storytelling, a comic touch and more than a few rays of sunshine. The story is crippled by special effects from start to finish."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,70,"Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice Ultimate Edition is not only a complete story, it's what we should have seen in theaters."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,71,"The 30 new minutes of footage added to Batman v Superman for its Ultimate Edition may add a little bit to one of the film's multiple plotlines, but overall, its inclusion is rather insignificant in regards to helping it solve its numerous issues."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,72,"Wildly overstuffed and oddly slapdash, filled with characters and sequences that serve little purpose other than to set up a 'cinematic universe.'"
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,73,"It wants to be a lot of things, and it keeps on falling short; but it's not afraid to go Very Big in its attempts to return to the idea of superheroes as modern mythology."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,74,"I wish I could tell you more, but honestly it's all just a blur of pretentious speeches about what lurks in the hearts of men and noisy fight scenes and nonsensical dream sequences."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,75,"Snyder's gone all drab and dire, determined to lay siege to our senses (and plot). There's so much glowering, gloominess and good-ness talk that it's hard to imagine the sun, or justice, ever dawning for this disastrous cavalcade of dreary characters."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,76,"All of the uber-muscled, color-drained visual and aural bombast in the world can't hide the ugly truth about Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. It's dumb as bricks."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,77,"It's hard to imagine a big-budget film worse than Avengers Age of Ultron or even Gods of Egypt - there, it's been said - but Batman vs Superman has the dubious distinction of showing utter contempt for its audience and wearing that contempt on its sleeve."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,78,"Again a studio stands on the precipice of a layered marketing plan, and again the movie its sky castle is built on is every bit as hollow and empty-headed as an action figure."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,79,"I have a long list of things that made me very angry about Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice, which in no particular order looks something like this : Superman's character behaving like a petulant teenager... The anticlimactic climactic moment."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,80,Batman v Superman is a step forward for the studio and it promises great things to come from DC. [Full review in Spanish]
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,81,"The conflict between the title characters is really, really hard to buy into and the screenplay drags it out as long as possible."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,82,"Over two-and-a-half hours, it stumbles its way through what feels like at least three different movies with clumsy tonal shifts and an entirely confused, barely-existent plot."

DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,92,"If a filmmaker attempted to combine everything casual moviegoers don't like about superhero franchises, they couldn't come up with a picture as execrable as this one."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,93,"A momentum-less ode to uncreative people everywhere that torches two of pop culture's greatest characters and uses their ashes as a urinal cake."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,94,"You take the good. You take the bad. You take them both and there you have a Zack Snyder film. It's par for the course for anyone who's followed his films. A little pleasantry and a little frustration mixed together."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,95,The most expensive prank ever committed to film.
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,96,"Basically, this is a little over half an hour of good action scenes framed by two hours of narrative nonsense."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,97,"The film's only other notable ingredients, sadly, are the most rumbling soundtrack since Earthquake, a lot of jaw grinding by Ben Affleck, some narrative confusion remarkable even by director Zack Snyder's standards, and... hours and hours of your time."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,98,Extraordinarily muddled and boring.

DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,101,"In this age of petty Marvels, most comic-book movies merely perpetrate fantasies of power, but Snyder, enacting his personal aesthetic, braves a film that examines those fantasies. He boldly challenges popular culture's current decay."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,102,"As a superhero flick, it's shockingly joyless and overlong, with the two iconic crimefighters presented as angry, cranky, easily manipulated men in tights."

DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,107,"Batman v Superman is a lunking, clumsy, beautiful and thrilling behemoth of a film. The faults are there for all to see. But so are the good points."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,108,"The result is ugly in every sense of the word -- grimy, incoherent and a stupefying bore; everybody looks like they need a bath and the movie is as drained of fun as it is of light and color."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,109,"Unfortunately, director Zach Snyder's scattershot, overly complicated and hugely drawn-out exposition depletes the story of all its fun and power, reducing his leads to impotent cranks."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,110,"The film is so big and loud that it can't help but feel bloated, especially since so much of what's on screen feels rather vacuous. But it looks amazing and is relentlessly gripping."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,111,Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is a profoundly dissatisfying film.
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,112,Batman threatened by Superman? Affleck never gets into the character but gets all the close-ups. Eisenberg needs a new acting style and Alfred hates his employer.
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,113,"Batman v Superman is a hot, steaming heap of trash."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,114,Really?
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,115,"It is the job of the modern superhero movie to explore at extravagant length and in morose detail the burden rather than the bliss of being one of the saviours of mankind, self-appointed or otherwise."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,116,A film that should be more dynamic and practical than poetic and metaphoric. [Full review in Spanish]
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,117,This thing is atrocious.
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,118,"Overblown and over-long as it is, the film sets up the series to come with a sure sense of its aficionados' wants and needs. It's the perfect launch pad."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,119,"Too competent to be universally panned, too disjointed to be universally praised, too anticipated to be a new revelation, too beloved in subject to be easily dismissed, the film will be one people either passionately love or passionately hate."

DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,121,"Above all of it's flaws, what works in Batman v Superman is enough to please the less demanding audiences. [Full review in Spanish]"
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,122,"I was at least hoping for a grand, jaw-dropping folly (like Snyder's 2011 Sucker Punch), but got something far more ordinary."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,123,"Yes, it's flashy and forgettable, but one truth is self-evident: DC comic book movies make money. Scowling superheroes rule!"
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,124,"Production alone isn't enough to carry a film."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,125,"The movie aspires to be real, groundbreaking, and important in a way that can only recall Will Arnett's Batman in The Lego Movie, a film with more wit, fewer ""it was only a dream"" montages of gloom, and, truth be told, more believable special effects."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,126,"Discounting its unevenness, the film's greatest flaw is its lack of tangible stakes, particularly given the subject matter."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,127,"With the chore ""Batman v Superman"" inevitably becomes, I have little faith the actual ""Justice League"" film will be any better."

DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,130,"The film is so focused on establishing its protagonists as the faces of the DC Universe that it ends up sucking all the joy and fun out of what, as a standalone film, should have been an epic movie event."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,131,"It's tedious. Except when it's laughable."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,132,"Like a movie from the world of Watchmen: cold, cruel, borderline incoherent in its testosterone-fueled rage, misogynist, paternalistic... fascist, even."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,133,"There's a lot going on screen, but somehow nothing keeps you from getting bored. [Full review in Spanish]"
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,134,"While the superhero films of Christopher Nolan carefully established their own coherent world and remained faithful to it, Mr Snyder's saga loses control of its various sub-plots early on and descends into chaos."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,135,"Director Zack Snyder teams up with writer David S Goyer to deliver what is a huge, ambitious and action-packed film."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,136,"not nearly as bad as some critics have made it out to be, but it nevertheless fails to achieve the kind of pop-mythic grandeur for which it was destined"
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,137,"There's a modicum of depth in the new superhero drama. Unfortunately, it's buried underneath a grim faade and an unrepentant reliance on loud fight sequences."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,138,"Full of loud misery and fiery battle, the film is a derivative of its genre and other filmic elements"
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,139,"Operatic and loaded with potential, this overloud, overlong fantasy with mega-stunts fit for the superheroes at its centre is a mess: an onslaught of too much, too often and for too long"
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,140,"""Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice"" takes an inordinate amount of time setting up the story --- and getting to the good part."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,141,The film generates zero tension from what is implicitly marketed as a seismic battle of super heroes.
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,142,"There's a good movie inside this one somewhere, but it would take a talented and ruthless editor to find it."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,143,"Big, bruising and more than a little bizarre. Mostly in a good way."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,144,There is enough going on in Batman v Superman to fill a dozen films.
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,145,Director Zack Snyder has blown it.
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,146,"For all its overcranked spectacle, I emerged from Batman v Superman in a soporific state; foggy of head, heavy of heart, wondering if it was all just a bad dream."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,147,...just another incompetent endeavor from an almost shockingly untalented filmmaker.
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,148,"Dawn of Justice's aim of reshaping our image and understanding of Batman is squandered under the weight of its incoherent and undisciplined narrative."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,149,"Worst of all is this: there's not an ounce of fun to be found in the film's entire two and half hours (Splice Today)"
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,150,"I wouldn't quite call it a ""good"" movie, nor would I be able to quite recommend it to anyone but the true believers. To be sure, it's a mess, but it's often a fascinating mess. It's also the most nihilistic superhero picture I've ever seen."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,151,"Watching ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,"" one thing is clear: Director Zack Snyder loves sparks. They're emanating from everywhere -- everywhere, that is, except his hapless story about superheroes missing their mommies."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,152,"Let's face it, Christian Bale's Batman was going to be a hard act for any actor to follow."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,153,"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice isn't in any way a perfect comic book movie, but it has enough going for it that will make fans happy."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,154,"Their first big-screen pairing is a hot mess, with too many storylines to get through to enjoy the elaborate production design or even figure out how we're supposed to feel."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,155,"If Christopher Reeve were alive he'd be suing for character libel."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,156,"Dour, disappointing and shockingly incoherent."

DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,164,"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice provides celebration and euphoric material, especially for fans of the graphic novels that serve as inspiration. It delivers a story with flaws and an uneven development for its characters. [Full review in Spanish]"

DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,166,"When was it decided superhero movies shouldn't be any fun?"
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,167,"Conjures a post-9/11 pre-apocalypse in which dreams, visions, memories, pop culture and history overlap."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,168,"The flawed 'Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice' is at least interesting enough to keep dusk from falling on the Justice League."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,169,"'Dawn of Justice' is a test of will and of stamina."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,170,"Bam! CGI defeats 'Batman v Superman.'"
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,171,"One of the worst superhero movies ever made. It is worse than Batman & Robin. It is worse than Catwoman. It is worse than last summer's Fantastic Four. A lugubrious experience that squanders every ounce of promise."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,172,"They're like two celebrities having a Twitter fight, and while some of it is written with humour, most of it feels leaden - not just because the writing is monotonously earnest, but neither lead is capable of pulling it off the page and making it bounce."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,173,"Enjoyable, if a bit uneven."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,174,"I wouldn't mind if these guys were dour depressives or psychopathic murderers as long as they didn't spend ten minutes talking about it first."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,175,"This is a high-quality superhero movie for adults, which is a pleasant, almost superhuman, development."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,176,"Impressive as it is in scale, Batman v Superman is exhausting. Snyder wants you to feel the pain when the two heroes are clobbering each other, and you will. If that's what you crave from movies, have at it."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,177,"I found myself thinking horrid, unspeakable thoughts during the screening. Thoughts like, 'come back Joel Schumacher, all is forgiven!' and 'maybe David Hasselhoff's Nick Fury wasn't so bad.' What kind of superhero movie DOES THAT to a man?"
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,178,"[I] really wanted this to work both on its own and as the real launch of a series of DC Comics-based movies akin to Marvel's cinematic universe. But yes, I was that disappointed. This film is an artistic failure on almost every level."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,179,"Everything is shrouded in a kind of black sludge, and frankly, it's depressing. Even the would-be iconic meeting of Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman looks like it was ground out from an old Xerox copier."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,180,"Promising but overlong superhero mash-up is dark, violent."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,181,"There's no joy here, no wonder or spectacle, just a relentlessly grim and intense grind that can't stop reminding you how grim and intense it is."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,182,"Batman V Superman is DC's Iron Man 2 - an okay movie that prioritizes shared universe setup over developing a coherent story and layered characters."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,183,"The sandbox they are given to romp around in is stupid, stupid stupid."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,184,"While the battle scenes are spectacular, the special effect I suspect will most appeal to the film's target audience - 15-year-old males - is Amy Adams in her bathtub, performing a PG-13 homage to Gypsy Rose Lee."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,185,"Now don't worry, we're not dealing with a travesty of Michael Bay proportions here. There is still plenty to be impressed with if you're a fan of things blowing up and people punching each other."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,186,"A boring, confused film swollen with self-importance."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,187,"The director has a knack for constructing cool moments, but consistently fails to tie them together cohesively. He has neat ideas, but has trouble executing them."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,188,They should have got Perry White to go through the script with his blue pencil.
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,189,"The movie does have a few brief, bright spots, and the actual 20-minute battle between Batman and Superman offers some enjoyment. But overall, this film should have been way more satisfying."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,190,"The bottom line on Batman v Superman, then, is that it is an entertaining but flawed step up from ""Man of Steel,"" and is a dark, action-packed setup for future Justice League films."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,191,"Yes, it's always nice to see actors of the caliber of Holly Hunter (as a skeptical judge) and Jeremy Irons (as Alfred the butler) get to do something-anything!-in these big splashy movies, but human presence here feels surplus to requirements."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,192,"Zack Snyder's production company is called Cruel and Unusual Films. Anything I say from this point on is probably redundant, but here we are."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,193,"How do you solve the problem of Superman? It's a hurdle that not even the producers of ""Batman v Superman"" can leap in a single bound."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,194,Batman v Superman is just good enough to keep the DC Comics movie plans on track. Barely.
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,195,"Not a total fiasco. When Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman finally leaps into the fray, deep into the picture's second half, she more than passes the audition."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,196,"Snyder creates a series of bigger explosions and greater ""inescapable"" scenarios which works itself to absurdity until the audience, not the villain, is beaten into submission."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,197,"A super slog through empty scenes, boring performances, nonexistent storytelling, and constant questions about motivations."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,198,"After 2-1/2 hours of sitting through relentless CGI violent visuals and deafening sound effects, I was exhausted."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,199,RIDDLE me this: how do you put three of the greatest comic book superheroes of all time into one big-budget movie and still make a mess of it?
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,200,"The movie has a bullying, hostile tone that comes through in the surly performances, a callous indifference to innocents killed and the general philosophical disposition of a teenager who just discovered Nietzsche after being grounded."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,201,"Director Zach Snyder delivers an intense epic tale of DC Comics greatest heroes. Ben Affleck owns Batman and despite a long winded and flawed third act, a superb introduction into the DC Universe. See it in IMAX!"
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,202,"It's like putting your head in a beehive for two and a half hours."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,203,"...the climactic battle(s) go on a bit long, although Cavill has grown comfortable since Man of Steel and Affleck successfully takes over from Christian Bale."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,204,"Truthfully, despite all my grievances, I rather liked BVS. Unlike nearly all of the Marvel movies, it feels like the work of an actual filmmaker instead of a glorified television production."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,205,"Absolutely, positively brilliant."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,206,Stick to the trailer.
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,207,"Incoherent, tedious and largely devoid of wit."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,208,"Sure, it looks great, and everything billows, including capes, trenchcoats and Lex's locks. But strong visuals alone aren't enough to make a graphic novel great, let alone a movie with a production budget north of $200 million."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,209,"Have you ever wondered what it would be like to have your head driven through solid rock and glass and brick walls for two and a half hours, blinding flashes of lights unceasingly forcing your eyes shut?"
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,210,"At the end of the dawn, there's no real justice per se, just smug, contrived posturing of what's to come - something Snyder & Co. are banking on."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,211,A dark and moody comic-book film with noble ambitions but the fizz of a week-old glass of Coke.
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,212,"While it's one thing to take superheroes seriously, it's another to drain all the fun out of them."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,213,"[Batman v Superman is] attempting to cram in too much and as a result, fails to deliver anything individual enough to stand out."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,214,"This is a superhero film which opens and closes with funerals and requires the world's finest detective and an avatar of truth and justice to batter each other (and everyone else) senseless for two-and-a-half hours."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,215,"It is astoundingly discouraging to say that Batman v Superman is sloppy, under developed, and unsatisfying as both a comic book film and an entertaining piece of cinema. But hey, at least you have Doomsday's camel toe to keep you warm at night."

DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,219,"It's freighted not so much with entertainment value as it is with enough talk of fallen gods, absent parents, and dissolute heroes to fuel a Greek tragedy. And ... director Zack Snyder seems convinced that that's what he's making."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,220,Great spectacle but poor character development overshadow whatever we might see on the screen. [Full review in Spanish]
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,221,"The showdown between DC's greatest heroes is spectacular, the only thing is that both leads lack charisma. [Full review in Spanish]"
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,222,"Zack Snyder manages to capture the dark tone we saw in Watchmen, especially in the first half of the film. [Full review in Spanish]"
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,223,"A brooding, but most importantly intelligent take on the seminal figures of our 20th century pop culture mythology, a movie that at once pays tribute to these characters' roots while offering up modern incarnations of them that ring true for our times."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,224,Sinks any chance DC had to compete against Marvel. [Full review in Spanish]
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,225,"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is so occupied with trying to do about a dozen, different things that it forgets to provide a reason for doing any of them."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,226,"The movie is Bat-s--t crazy. A dour, disdain-filled demeanor, plus a gluttony of complex plot twists, dissipates most of the contact high."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,227,"A bombastic and incoherent world overflowing with half-baked allegory, baffling characterisation and back-breaking mythological portent. It's a laudably bold, utterly exhausting, mess of a film."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,228,"With nobody to root for, BvS:DoJ is just an unconscionably long slugfest simultaneously attempting too much and accomplishing almost nothing."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,229,"[it] does have some shining moments, but they are too few and far between in an effort that is overflowing with illogicalities, gaping plot holes and moments that simply don't make sense in any fundamental way that relates to the characters."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,230,"I'm not sure what Snyder has against these characters, why he is so determined to make them as distasteful as possible."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,231,"[A] glum, cool-toned behemoth that labors to lay groundwork for a DC cinematic universe while setting up two famous characters on a collision course, and lobs out big ideas like an underprepared undergrad sweatily pitching off-the-cuff thesis topics."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,232,"It's not terrible, but it is terribly long, terribly convoluted and terribly bombastic, with a score that would make Richard Wagner ask if they could please turn it down."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,233,"The film might be pretty to look at, but narratively speaking, it is a disaster."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,234,"Wow. It's worse than I'd feared."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,235,Batman Vs Superman promises much but ends up proving to be something of a false dawn.
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,236,"Yes Affleck's good, Cavill fills out his suit prettily enough and when the two are going chin-to-chin, dimple-to-dimple, it makes for a mighty clash of the titans. It's just the movie they get to do that in is more batty than super."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,237,An artillery barrage of action.
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,238,"The film has its moments, but there comes a point when you can't justify it to yourself any longer. There is only so much grim brooding one movie can accommodate."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,239,"It's sweaty, grunty, loud, self-congratulatory and, if movies had smells, pungent."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,240,"The set-up of the first third of the film drags, but once it gets going it builds up the momentum to one very big fight, dragging you in its wake."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,241,"[Batman v Superman] looks rich, explores some interesting notions about justice, vengeance and deterrence, and works wonderfully until a CGI creature emerges as an adversary."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,242,"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice will probably please those who just want to see their comic book heroes come to life in a visually stunning way, but it will frustrate anyone looking for substance."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,243,The brow-furrowing over vigilante justice is as pointless as the back story of Batman that opens the movie.
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,244,"Often steers into think-tank territory--about gods and demons, politics and paranoia--and pumps up the religious allegory and symbolism that have always been part of the Superman mythos."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,245,"Overstuffed, fidgety and fearful, it's a blockbuster for the less flattering features of our time."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,246,Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice was supposed to settle a fanboy debate older than Adam West. Instead it raises another: Is being a superhero really this much of a drag?
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,247,"Affleck and Gadot are impressive in their debuts, but there really are no winners in Batman v Superman. That includes moviegoers looking for anything resembling a good time."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,248,"Underdeveloped, overlong and stupendously dispiriting."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,249,"Since the movie is opening in the midst of the Syrian refugee crisis and just days after the Brussels attacks, the hostility conjured between these superheroes feels incredibly and uncomfortably pertinent."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,250,"While the film's final-act battle delivers better bang than some Marvel movies, Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice too often forgets why we're here in the first place."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,251,"Unfairly maligned, Snyder's dark vision is impressive and starkly different from the competition. The plot is perhaps too ambitious but the film delivers more often than it doesn't with Affleck's Bruce Wayne and Gal Gadot being highlights."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,252,"Though it's scary to think that Warner Bros. is betting the future of its entire DC Comics film slate on this highly-anticipated clash of superhero icons, the real loser is the audience itself."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,253,"...has some standout scenes (a Superman Congressional hearing, any featuring Luthor), but its climax short circuits and too many of its themes are squandered."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,254,"Snyder delivers a superhero epic that's a significant improvement on his work on its predecessor, ""Man of Steel."""
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,255,"At the end of the UK press screening there were pockets of cheers from the crowd and I literally could not hold in an exclamation of ""Are you f*cking serious?"""
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,256,"Decent at times, but otherwise a jumbled and mostly joyless mess. (Full Content Review for Parents - Sex, Violence, Profanity, etc. - Also Available)"
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,257,"Snyder's films are so eager to establish that ""Superman was never real"" that they never permit even the illusion that he ever was."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,258,"Zack Snyder's wearying superhero opus may be slugged ""Dawn of Justice,"" but it's the twilight of any hope that the filmmaker will find the fun in the DC Universe."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,259,"Sure it is full of sound & fury, but it is also brimming with ideas, * if anything, its 150min duration feels insufficient to contain its sprawling story - like a mutant monster, barreling out of control & straining to contain its own shifting form."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,260,"It's a terrible shame that what we ended up with was a meandering mishmash of garbled storylines and action sequences."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,261,"For Snyder, it's among his better films, even though it doesn't offer a single memorable image or idea."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,262,"The best? Affleck in the Batsuit. The worst? Eisenberg's Lex Luthor and much of the first two hours of the film."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,263,"'BvS' is a short cut so concerned with setting up the next films to come it forgets that it needs to work as one itself."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,264,"In the end, a daft but interesting blockbuster becomes a daft and self-defeating one."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,265,"More befuddled, plot-wise, than just about any other superhero epic of the last decade, Batman v Superman nevertheless deserves points for creating a vision of modern America that feels truly fractured."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,266,"Despite the avalanche of set pieces and nods to upcoming Justice League movies, it must be said that Affleck is the class act - he fits his bat suit well and also nails Bruce Wayne, whether as ageing rou or haunted hero."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,267,Batman V Superman: Dawn Of Justice is a punishing experience. But not an entirely unenjoyable one.
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,268,"It's like an entire TV season condensed into a chaotic highlight reel, simultaneously way too long and not nearly long enough."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,269,"Instead of focusing on the story it's telling, the movie seems scattered, unfocused, obviously feeling the weight of the obligation to prepare the ground for the next ones. [Full review in Portuguese]"
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,270,"Snyder loves to destroy things, and that's essentially all the film has to offer, finding the production more interested in deafening the audience instead of trying to thrill them."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,271,It is big. It is loud. It is violent. But it is a crappy CG blur interrupted by close-ups of this one or that one taking/making an impact or landing.
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,272,"I'm fascinated by the retroactive recontextualization of everything I hated about Man of Steel's ending... It's the stuff of adolescent dreams, yet...Snyder and his team manage to make Batman v Superman feel almost, dare I say it, adult."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,273,"Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen cycle feels like an antic 1930s screwball comedy compared to Zack Snyder's seriously patience-trying Sturm und Drang that signifies, well, nothing much, apart from the dawn of the forthcoming Justice League."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,274,"Batman v Superman is kind of dopey and plays out some laborious plot twists in the DC narrative at unnecessary length, but as I've already said it largely kept me entertained for two and a half hours, which is not nothing."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,275,"A loud, cluttered, joyless muddle that might be described as Snyderissimo-which might please DC and diehard fans but will probably put off those accustomed to the breezier tone of the Marvel universe."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,276,"Spoiler alert: It's not very good."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,277,"For the life of me, after two and a half hours, I couldn't tell you why Batman and Superman were fighting."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,278,"[Much] of the action... is a dog's breakfast of discombobulating editing. The film's final passages are such an aggressively hard to watch collision of excessive CGI and murky colour palate that it's hard to make heads or tails of most of it."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,279,"Although viewers may be riveted at times, the net experience isn't much fun."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,280,"I'm inclined to think that large and loud Batman v Superman is what happens when no limits are placed on a project."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,281,"Did you ever think you'd long for the horrible puns and scenery chewing of the campy '90s Batman movies?"
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,282,"Blunt, humorless, and baffling, it collides the brutish directorial stamp of its director (he of 300 and Watchmen fame) with the most shameless instincts of our latter-day superhero franchise bubble."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,283,"In the words of The Joker in a far better Batman movie: ""Why so serious?"""
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,284,An enjoyable watch.
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,285,Did we need 150 minutes to watch slyly crafted revisionism turn to special-effects kitsch and rampage?
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,286,"Eventually the script's illogic and the relentless pounding of the action scenes wear you down."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,287,"Moments of visual splendor can't save Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice, a comically, cosmically terrible waste of a blockbuster budget, from its disjointed, dreary narrative and vacuous treatment of its central, long-anticipated conflict."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,288,"[It's] such a miscalculated ploy that it puts future releases under the brand on immediately shaky footing. The film has too much on its plate, but that belies the incompetence with which it is handled as a story, much less as a product."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,289,"Snyder and company wouldn't understand the possible joy within the genre if it jumped up and bit them in the ambitions"
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,290,"One of the greatest Super-Hero Slobberknockers ever filmed! Not Batman v Superman, that fight sucked. The stars of this movie are Doomsday and Wonder Woman! Movie falls just shy of Greatness & hit me in all my fangirl parts! ."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,291,"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is basically a dumpster fire. But from that rubble, there is something salvageable."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,292,That rare movie that makes you anxious to see the next installment only because it surely has to be better than what you just watched.
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,293,"It'll make you feel like s***."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,294,"At its heart, the promised battled between the DC titans has some punch. The blow is just softened considerably by worthless plot points that take the super out of superhero."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,295,"There's sure no joy in Gotham tonight, boys and girls. Because this bloated bust takes all the fun out of what could have been a flashy and fiery mash- up."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,296,"That fight comes late in the game, and it's so grim, humorless, and vicious, it stops being thrilling early on. It isn't in the service of any of the themes the film has struggled to express, it's just a meat-headed, brutal throwdown."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,297,"While the Marvel universe, now owned by Disney, is glib and sunny, it's a nice echo of Warner's past as a home to gangsters and gritty melodramas to find its DC world operating very much on the dark end of the street."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,298,"Where celluloid was once flecked with dream-sparkles of silver, Zack Snyder's darkest dark-beyond-dark digital project yet is all clutter and cloaca, as if sprayed and spackled with a sewer's worth of a city's ----."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,299,"At once lumbering and enthralling, overstuffed and auspicious."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,300,"A sequel that functions as origin story, apologia, and harbinger of a second expanded universe of overpopulated action bonanzas."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,301,"Fans have waited a long time to see these two icons on the screen together, and ""Batman v Superman"" is as big and bold as this momentous occasion deserves."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,302,"DC and Snyder jammed a lot into ""Batman v Superman"" to get back into the game. And it often works."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,303,"Batman v Superman does not have one genuinely surprising, thrilling moment. The rhythm sweeps us in relentlessly but without generating real excitement, and much of the time we feel trapped inside a clumsy narrative."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,304,"Rather than escapism and sensory exhilaration, viewers get down in the mire with protagonists who grimace, scowl and wince their way through heroics with the joyless determination of shift workers making the doughnuts."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,305,"The studio has, in the usual way, begged and bullied critics not to reveal plot points, and I wouldn't dream of denying you the thrill of discovering just how overstuffed and preposterous a movie narrative can be."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,306,"The first half is a solid followup to the Christopher Nolan Batman trilogy. Then the second half turns into a Zack Snyder movie, but that's not necessarily a bad thing."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,307,"'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice' is a cluttered, gloomy spectacle that does not live up to the three year wait. The choices made and direction by Zack Snyder have resulted in a shaky foundation for the Justice League."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,308,"Alas, these boys like to over-share. You might take solace in Wonder Woman's enigma, amid all the boys' clunking assertions of need and self."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,309,"In a word, exhausting. In a few more, overblown, overstuffed, repetitive, bombastic, and sometimes just dumb. (Never mind dreary to look at and punishing to hear.)"
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,310,A joyless slog.
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,311,"Go in with realistic expectations and you'll probably have a good time. After all, it's still a movie where man-gods punch each other."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,312,"One to see in the cinema, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is not quite the superhero movie we deserve, but it's just what we need right now to whet our appetites for the other projects coming down the line in the DC Comics extended universe."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,313,"Shouldn't all this geeky property colliding still at least be entertaining? Shouldn't it play to the cheap seats instead of wallowing in the murk?"
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,314,"Not as bad as Bush v. Gore, but close."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,315,"It's a shame that Batman v Superman is also a storytelling disgrace. It has maybe six opening scenes and jumps so incessantly from subplot to subplot that a script doctor would diagnose a peculiarly modern infection: ""disjunctivitis."""
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,316,"With its high-grade visuals, quick pacing and constant motion, Batman v Superman never bores. But it seems less like an actual movie for us than a two-hour, 31-minute sales pitch for the rumored DC Comics sequels yet to come."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,317,"The film rattles along at a breathtaking pace, making the two-and-a-half-hour running time easy going, and there are a couple of great gags thrown in to alleviate the somewhat largely sombre mood."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,318,"There are brilliant set pieces, adequate performances and acceptably whizzy bits of camera work. But there are also long, pointless and interminable scenes where the story should be being told, but in reality -- nothing of interest is happening."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,319,Snyder sets his story within our modern world and attempts to fashion a kind of commentary on the media and the current geopolitical situation. What he has crafted instead is a grotesque expression of modern emptiness.
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,320,"Snyder's movie presents extremist versions of familiar characters in a tonal mishmash that indulges in more thunderous conflict than it can wrestle into coherence."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,321,"There is a good movie inside of Batman v Superman, which makes it all the more frustrating that the stuff the movie gets wrong, it gets really wrong."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,322,"Megaton fight scenes are the reason people will put up with bad dialogue or bad logic in a film, so it's an outright tragedy when Batman v Superman's showdowns become as boring as the rest of it."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,323,"From its superfluous opening ... to its clichd final scene, ""BvS"" fails to ignite an emotional response - except, perhaps, dissatisfaction. It is unrelentingly grim and oppressive, sucking all the air out of the theater."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,324,"If it's action you want, Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice will not disappoint. But take away the interminable fight scenes, and the screenplay crashes into plot holes big enough to drive the Batmobile through."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,325,"For those who go to the movies to see coherent narratives, [this] is Hollywood's latest exercise in fan service...taking the usual screenplay ingredients of logic, reason and character motivation, tossing it all in a blender and filming the scraps."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,326,"There's a gravitas here that even the staleist of comic book tropes can't diminish. Snyder, who directed Man of Steel and the failed comic book adaptation Watchmen, is nothing less than respectful. The effects aren't bad, either."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,327,"Crushed under the weight of creating a Marvel-esque DC franchise, Batman v Superman fails to ever truly tap into the potential that a clash between two of the most revered superheroes of all time should technically provide."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,328,"All so vapidly grand and so serious and so, so dull."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,329,"Cool action, a strong performance by Ben Affleck, and Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman make Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice worth checking out on the big screen."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,330,"It's almost too much to take in, meaning that by the time we finally get to the titular grudge match you could well be over it. Nevertheless, there are elements here that work strongly and even spectacularly."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,331,In spite of the garbled story the characters get plenty of strong moments that play to their core appeal.
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,332,"To say that Superman v Batman: Dawn of Justice is a bad movie doesn't go far enough. This film feels like Zack Snyder hobbling the entire upcoming DC Movieverse before it gets started."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,333,"The story, like the testicles of a weightlifter on steroids, dwindles away to nothing."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,334,"There are fascinating questions here, but they're buried beneath the debris of a convoluted, horribly written story featuring poorly written characters making inexplicable choices."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,335,"Filled with scenes of gloomy characters confronting their demons or wrestling with insipid moral quandaries, this joyless slog isn't a superhero film so much as it is an excruciating therapy session with huge explosions and guys in capes."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,336,"Part sequel, part prequel, director Zack Snyder's film delivers on its titular promises -- eventually."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,337,"Ponderous, self-important, too long by at least 45 minutes, and do we really need another scene (and then ANOTHER scene) of Bruce Wayne's parents being shot?"
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,338,"[B]efore too long, Snyder has shaken off the self-reflection and returned to ... an empty seriousness where, for a few inspired scenes, some actual thought has flickered tantalizingly."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,339,A popcorn film - and this is  a popcorn film - should never feel like Sunday night homework.
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,340,"In Ben Affleck's Batman, here at last is the sadistic, fascistic, half-crazed vigilante that comics fans have been waiting for."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,341,"""Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice"" will have its admirers, others will relinquish in the fact that yet again, the superhero genre is not challenging itself to be better than what is expected of them."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,342,"Questions regarding violence and mayhem are drowned out by violence and mayhem. Such is the superhero life as directed by Zack Snyder. There is no problem that can't be solved with a cranium-rattling explosion or two."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,343,"I can't lie and call Batman v Superman a great movie. Not even for us superhero fans."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,344,"Ultimately it satisfies fan cravings to see two of the world's most popular superheroes throw down."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,345,"A movie that has brazenly refused to learn from its own past, and yet insultingly, boldly pretends to have grown and matured all the same."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,346,"The man knows how to make a movie that speaks the fanboy language, and ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" speaks it well."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,347,"Ponderous, but the tone and the cast hold our interest."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,348,"It so badly wants you to be excited for ""Justice League"" that it forgets to keep you excited about ""Batman v Superman."""
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,349,"The movie's not bad but it doubles down on its least-interesting and potent elements at the expense of those that actually work."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,350,"Everything surrounding the central fight is a mess, thanks to an incoherent plot and over-stuffed script that's burdened by its need to set up future Justice League movies."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,351,"An ambitious mess, an exhilarating chaos of visual flare and strong drive that's also in desperate need of direction, objectivity, restraint and coherence."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,352,"[SPOILER-FREE REVIEW:] This is not a drill, comic-book geeks."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,353,Watching Batman and Superman rage at each other like little boys makes for a pretty tedious two and a half hours.
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,354,"When it sings, Dawn of Justice is a wonder. When it drags, it still looks good and offers hints of a better scene just around the corner."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,355,Somebody stop Zack Snyder. Somebody save the world.
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,356,"A near-total drag, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice plays like a loose, unofficial quarter-billion-dollar remake of The Odd Couple, in which Oscar and Felix are literally trying to kill each other."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,357,"Disjointed, numbing and spectacular with its intemperance."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,358,"The heavyweight title bout between Batman and Superman is a smash to the senses, the same way being tossed around in a rollover car accident would jolt one's system."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,359,"Superhero movies are now like websites with too many pop-up ads, clogging the running time with teases for future films that won't be fun either."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,360,"[Plays] less like a prequel for the JLA then a greatest-hits medley of every superhero movie ever made -- a little Dark Knight Rises here, a bit of Batman Begins there, all spiced up with some X-Men topicality. The thing is, none of it convinces."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,361,"It's Batman v Superman v the contents of your bladder in Zack Snyder's too-long, 155-minute superhero slugfest."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,362,"There's enough mythic raw material sunk deep in every scene that you can piece together a classic in your mind if you're feeling charitable; but if you aren't, Batman v Superman will seem like a missed opportunity."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,363,"As superhero spectacles go, Zack Snyder's Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is a grand one, with a mondo-operatic climax and a final shot infused with quivering, exhilarating molecules of grace. It's also not much fun."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,364,"Snyder, juiced up by Hans Zimmer's caffeinated score, throws everything at the screen until resistance is futile."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,365,"The Dark Knight, RETURNS with a BANG, BOOM, POW; Wonder Woman arrives, fashionably late as you'd expect from the world's most iconic female superhero; but this emerging Superman may have you humming, ""will the REAL Man of Steel, please stand-up."""
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,366,"Affleck's bottom lip gives a solid performance, dominant but not overtly showy, channelling the spirit of lone warrior jawbones from John Ford films"
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,367,"One cannot walk away without noticing the plot holes that stops the film from being consistent. There are too many ""Whats, Whys, and Hows'"" being asked in one's mind that leaves them baffled."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,368,To call it ridden with plot holes would be a disservice to plot holes. These are plot caverns.
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,369,A big bombastic mess that never does enough with the characters to warrant bringing them together.
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,370,"An action-packed and epic start to the DC Films Universe, Batman v Superman will have you grinning from ear to ear from start to finish."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,371,"Overlong, underdeveloped and almost entirely humorless, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice may please die-hard fans by pitting two DC icons against each other. Everyone else may want to wait for the next Marvel movie."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,372,"Not only does the storytelling feel cluttered, but the premise turns both protagonists into passive victims who only occasionally get to do anything heroic. The rest of their time is spent navel-gazing and whinging to their respective confidantes."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,373,"If Justice, with its sluggish script, isn't quite the jaw-dropping eye-popper it should be, that's okay. The cast is unimpeachable."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,374,"For all the eye-popping spectacle here, the brilliance of some of the action sequences, and the full-blooded performances from Ben Affleck and Henry Cavill as the superheroes, this turns out to be a convoluted affair."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,375,"No amount of crash, bang or wallop can conceal this confused and ungainly storyline."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,376,"It just wears you down and wears you out, making you wonder if there was ever such a thing as a hero anyway. Let them pummel each other if they must; just leave us out of it."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,377,"It hurtles not with the kinetic momentum of Mad Max: Fury Road nor the comparatively spry skip of a Marvel movie, but with an operatic grandeur it sometimes earns and often doesn't."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,378,"Fans can rest easy, the film delivers and it does so in a spectacular way. [Full review in Spanish]"
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,379,"Constantly threatening to collapse from self-seriousness, this epic has way too much of everything, including CGI and Oscar winners up the wazoo."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,380,"The silver lining in the depressing Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice turns out to be that we can still look forward to 2017's Wonder Woman with something approaching a sense of hope. We're calling it better than nothing."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,381,"It is intermittently rewarding, but ultimately a bit disappointing."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,382,"Half of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is brilliant. Unfortunately, the other half of Zack Snyder's epic-length superhero movie is so bloated that it blunts the effect of the good stuff."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,383,"Goosebumps are inevitable when the two icons finally face off, and there are some spectacular clobberings dispensed, but it doesn't feel like, as Lex pitches it, ""the greatest gladiator battle in the history of the world""."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,384,"[T]he follow-up to The Dark Knight that many viewers and fans wanted or hoped for... [V]isually stunning, with powerful emotional storytelling and awe-inspiring action spectacle."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,385,"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice might not be the perfect comic book movie, but it's really entertaining. [Full review in Spanish]"
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,386,"When the head-to-head heavy hitting finally transpires -- be patient, for it takes some time to get there -- Dawn of Justice delivers the shock and awe on a level befitting a superhero blockbuster of such massive scale."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,387,"And what of the title's promised skirmish? That face-off between two comics legends becomes but one in a series of big things bashing into other big things, which is what Snyder and writers Chris Terrio and David S. Goyer mistake for storytelling."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,388,"The movie delivers and will please fans, even if you don't see it in 3D. [Full review in Spanish]"
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,389,"Gorging on bombast and self-importance, swamped by its own mythology, Batman v Superman is loud, sprawling, and distracted. The action jumps around almost as fast as a man can fly, but nowhere near as smoothly."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,390,Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice just lands with a big thud.
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,391,"There are moments that make the whole enterprise worthwhile, and introduces an intriguing new Batman. But it's also cluttered and narratively wonky; a few jokes wouldn't have gone amiss, either."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,392,"BvS will please those either waiting for the two main players to lock horns on a movie screen, or those who've just been pining for Wonder Woman forever."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,393,"No major blockbuster in years has been this incoherently structured, this seemingly uninterested in telling a story with clarity and purpose."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,394,"Lacks real character development and, consequently, a bit of soul that gives meaning to the pyrotechnics. [Full review in Spanish]"
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,395,"It's epic, involving, exciting, and ambitious, but there's an undeniable feeling that the best is yet to come."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,396,"Those expecting BvS to be DC's answer to Marvel's Avengers will find it more akin to Snyder's Watchmen instead."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,397,"As a pure visual spectacle, however, Batman V Superman ably blows the hinges off the multiplex doors, and editor David Brenner does excellent work to comprehensibly streamline the chaos, capably captured by d.p. Larry Fong."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,398,"Instead of playing up the differences between the Man of Steel and the Dark Knight, Batman v Superman flattens them."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,399,This superhero-smorgasbord directed by Zack Snyder melts into an electric soup of CGI. Effects are so overused that any conviction explodes in a giant fireball -- indeed endless fireballs. The result is an enervating two and a half hours.
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,400,"As its title implies, ""Batman v Superman"" plays like a mashup of things we've seen before."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,401,"It's another numbing smash-and-bash orgy of CGI mayhem with an ending that leaves the door open wide enough to justify the next 10 installments. Is it too late to demand a rematch?"
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,402,"All in all, job done, just about."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,403,"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is a treat for the eyes, but it will hurt your brain and break your heart."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,404,"The film may be imposing, but it's not fun."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,405,"In Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, the Dark Knight and the Man of Steel duke it out and the audience loses."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,406,"An improvement over Man of Steel, and a much better Batman movie than it is a Superman film. The highlights far outweigh the issues, and DC now has a base on which it can build its empire."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,407,Just put a bucket of generic Batman in here and stir in a few pints of own-label Superman. That will do to be going on with.
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,408,"This film has turned all of its great characters into perfunctory plot points, in the service of a plot that doesn't even work well."
DawnofJustice,DawnofJustice_rm,409,"If there's any justice, dawning or otherwise, at the multiplex, audiences will reject Zack Snyder's lumbering, dead-on-arrival superhero mlange, a $250 million tombstone for a genre in dire need of a break."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,0,"Doctor Strange, intended to be a mind-bending, rule-breaking rebuke to the squares of superhero cinema, turns out to be a rebel in name only -- the textbook definition of a bad trip."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,1,"Cumberbatch, both a natural comedian and a subtle one, knows how to get a big laugh from nothing more than an arched eyebrow."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,2,"With Dr. Strange the Marvel magic seems largely to have run out-which is unfortunate, given the movie's titular protagonist is himself a magician."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,3,"Lives up to its title, in mostly good ways."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,4,"Doctor Strange is about as weird as any Marvel movie is going to get these days, which is not particularly weird."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,5,"The Marvel Comics movie universe gets a bit bigger, though not appreciably better, with Doctor Strange."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,6,Doctor Strange delivers a satisfying origin story for the Sorcerer Supreme while drawing upon the comic book visuals in an entertaining way.
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,7,"It showed me something new that I haven't seen in a superhero movie, which at this point is a pretty impressive feat."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,8,"I was dubious as to how well a weirdly bearded wizard would fit into the universe of buff superheroes and high-tech punch-ups, but this is Marvel through and through."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,9,"The movie is well paced, clipping along quite nicely and the tone is carefully controlled."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,10,"Not only the best-looking Marvel film but one of the most mind-bending and striking visual experiences in cinema, Doctor Strange is easy to recommend, even if it does lack some of the charm and depth of its MCU siblings."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,11,"[Doctor Strange] could have misfired. Instead, it is visually rich, powerfully performed and surprisingly fun."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,12,"It is a stunning, stimulating and utterly satisfying introduction to the character as Marvel continue to push the envelope."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,13,"Benedict Cumberbatch's egotistical Ironman-meets-House-MD persona keeps us in the game - if only just. He shares more chemistry with his eccentric levitation cloak than with most humans in the film."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,14,"Swinton and Cumberbatch are both delightful, although I'm not sure I've ever seen either one have a bad showing."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,15,[Doctor Strange] may be the most visually stunning entry into the MCU pantheon so far.
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,16,"Entre un protagónico que casi no convence, un villano de cartón, arcos argumentales insultantemente inconclusos y una batalla final anticlimática, Doctor Strange es una extraña decepción."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,17,...wears its spirituality on its sleeve (or its levitating cloak)...
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,18,Doctor Strange breaks new ground from everything so far (in the Marvel Cinematic Universe)...new dimensions even. What a trip!
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,19,"Not only is [Cumberbatch] charming as Doctor Strange, but he becomes quite the comedian in the film as well."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,20,"The high calibre of talent associated with this spry comicbook actioner definitely ensures another super-hero film franchise-in-the-making as Cumberbatch's introspective doc administers his 'Strange' dosage of Marvel movie-making medicine for the ages."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,21,"With Doctor Strange, Marvel pries open a doorway to a new realm, one filled with magic and mysticism, dark dimensions and malevolent deities."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,22,"Like looking at a black light poster on uppers: It's visually lovely, and you're having a good time, but there's also a small nagging sense that somebody might have brought the wrong drugs to the party."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,23,Another package from the conveyer belt of prototypical superhero movies with crap CGI and a relentless cacophony of action sequences where nothing ever really feels at stake.
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,24,"Doctor Strange's mystic realms and otherworldly dimensions are grounded in an obvious affection for the comic book source material...while breaking the boundaries once again of the ever-expanding edifice that is the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,25,What Doctor Strange has that no other comic book movie does is a wild visual style that pushes the boundaries of effects technology while dazzling the audiences with imagery that is as colorful and bizarre as anything Jack Kirby committed to paper.
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,26,"What it lacks in story originality, it more than makes up for with aesthetic creativity."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,27,"It's a mind-bending, colorful, unabashedly outrageous shot of adrenaline, one the MCU didn't even know it needed. The Doctor is most certainly in."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,28,Offers another accomplishment in the MCU origin canon with a character driven film with spectacularly spellbinding visuals and a great performance by Benedict Cumberbatch.
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,29,"A movie that improves on repeat viewings, and after seeing subsequent MCU movies. Problematic casting, but lots of good otherwise."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,30,What makes the movie interesting is its supporting characters-the arthouse stars providing the movie with heroes and villains.
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,31,"Doctor Strange works great as a standalone film, and its visual inventiveness is a breath of fresh air, as most films in the MCU have tended to come from a cookie-cutter approach these days."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,32,"The characters are very human, which is why I enjoy Marvel so much."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,33,"You're hit with how visually stunning this damn movie is. I'm tempted to go back and watch in IMAX or 3D."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,34,"The parts might seem (sometimes problematically) familiar, but there's new magic here."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,35,"Cumberbatch - startled otter looks, goatee and all - duly nails the part of the good-ish Doctor from the off."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,36,"""Doctor Strange"" works when it wants to and it's two hours of general enjoyment; however, as the plot inches towards the end, the film begins to rely heavily on Marvel's comfortable setup to move it forward."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,37,"I wasn't super jazzed about Cumberbatch. SO, that being said, I think he did a fantastic job in the role."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,38,"Performances are strong, with Cumberbatch at peak charm-he seems to channel Harrison Ford as Han Solo here and Doctor Strange is genuinely funny."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,39,"Certainly Doctor Strange isn't perfect, but the fast-paced fun generally makes up for some of the lazy worldbuilding. And the best part is that the movie never gets too silly and never gets too dark."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,40,"It's by far one of the most visually interesting films out this year, with a world filled with new concepts that I left the film convinced of, thanks to the compelling visuals."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,41,"Benedict Cumberbatch gives, above all, a very personal touch to the arrogant doctor... [Full review in Spanish]"
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,42,"Doctor Strange's magical battles turn Manhattan into a concrete kaleidoscope - worth watching on the biggest screen you can find."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,43,"What I particularly liked about any elements that this movie adds to the MCU, is that it does so in a way that feels organic."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,44,"Buoyed by magnetic performances from Cumberbatch (sporting an American accent!) and Swinton, Derrickson takes exhilarating visual and storytelling risks and carries the genre to new heights."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,45,The way they use magic for fights is where the unique nature of this film lies.
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,46,One of my favorite Marvel movies ever.
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,47,"Benedict Cumberbatch might not fit the leading man profile, but he wears the Doctor Strange uniform well."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,48,"While the intricacies of the mystical world can be confusing at times, our introduction to this side of the Marvel Universe makes for a thoroughly enjoyable viewing experience, thanks to dazzling 3-D visual effects."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,49,"Doctor Strange elevates yet another relatively unknown Marvel character to top tier status, making it well worth a dizzying watch in 3D."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,50,"While sufficiently hitting all the correct targets, the most refreshing addition is how it melds mind-bending, show-stopping, kaleidoscopic visuals with its narrative stakes."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,51,Dr Strange provides an enriching and exhilarating experience.
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,52,"It's handicapped by performances that are decent but not great, an over-abundance of visual effects that are state-of-the-art but far too familiar, and a storyline that just gets sillier the longer it goes on."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,53,So you just have to take the good with the bad. What works in Doctor Strange works REALLY WELL.
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,54,"[Tilda] Swinton, I would argue, is the most underrated actor of this generation, and she deserves to be held in the highest of esteem."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,55,"When Dr. Strange folds and warps time, energy and space, it becomes a visual feast reminiscent of Inception, but it also visualizes his journey."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,56,"Doctor Strange might have a lot of baggage, but more than anything else, it's fun."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,57,The film is bloated and unfunny... and is plagued by a boringly retrograde notion of pan-Asian-ness while conveniently escaping the burden of casting any actual Asians in its principal roles.
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,58,"Indeed, Doctor Strange's climactic redemption is as spellbinding as it is satisfying. But of course, we know the magic is just getting started."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,59,"When Doctor Strange works, it's for the same reasons most of the Marvel movies do: They aren't afraid of humor, and they know what's funny."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,60,"Strange is pretty much the same sort of movie we've seen from Marvel Studios ever since Robert Downey Jr. snarked his way through the first Iron Man and into our hearts all those years ago, and the same style of origin Marvel has been delivering since."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,61,"Doctor Strange has all the strengths of a Marvel movie-a well-told story, a well-tuned sense of humor about itself, a personal drama to shape the hero's journey-as well as all the weaknesses (conventions of a superhero origin tale are getting repetitive)."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,62,"Marvel's best film to date is a surprisingly beautiful, eccentric, and generous fable of interpersonal, political, and cosmic communion."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,63,"While Doctor Strange boasts a great performance from Benedict Cumberbatch and mind-bending, Oscar-nominated special effects, it leaves a little to be desired when it comes to its potentially-intriguing, but ultimately action-filled narrative."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,64,"The effects are the closest most of us will get to tripping balls in a Disney movie outside of dropping acid and watching ""Pink Elephants on Parade"" on a YouTube loop."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,65,"OK, so Dr. Strange is not as soulful as expected. But in this particular reality, I'll take what I can get."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,66,"Doctor Strange's last act is so trippy and exciting that you can almost forgive that generic story."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,67,"Though Doctor Strange's impressive visual effects and head-spinning mythology might seem a bit much for Marvel's typical filmgoing crowd, its story is rudimentary enough to keep the more far-reaching elements relatively grounded."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,68,The movie is very much Harry Potter for adults.
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,69,[An] underwhelming panel-to-screen Marvel adaptation.
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,70,"This summer's superhero films may have fallen a bit flat but this one is magic."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,71,"The overall experience of Doctor Strange is wonderfully fun... provided you don't try to dig a little deeper."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,72,"Doctor Strange is another win for Marvel, and proof that there are some new tricks to be found in superhero movies after all."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,73,"A clear example of an amazing and commited cast, that take their work seriously, no matter how silly the premise is. [Full review in Spanish]"
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,74,"For all the talk of alternate dimensions and sightings of a bald Tilda Swinton, Scott Derrickson's film is a sturdy addition to the superhero saga that's been slotting in compatible pieces since Iron Man delivered its first wisecrack in 2008."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,75,"Dr. Strange is not only entertaining and absurd. It's also an intelligent film. [Full review in Spanish]"
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,76,Quite possibly the worst of the Marvel movies...
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,77,"Strip away the thick rind of make-up and the comedy Hugh Laurie accent, and Strange is exactly like every role Cumberbatch has ever played."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,78,"It's not a tremendously rewarding piece of storytelling... But it's dang cool."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,79,"My reaction to this movie is mixed, at best."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,80,"Strange can do great things by the end of the movie, but he still has a lot to learn before he can take on the title of Sorcerer Supreme - and that should be fun to watch, too."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,81,"Brings much in the way of tasty popcorn spirituality to match it's brilliant filmmaking."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,82,"Dr Strange isn't just any old superhero, he's not gaudy and violent, he's smarter, he's gentler. He's basically a much nicer Sherlock... in a cape."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,83,"Doctor Strange shines not just courtesy of its left-of-centre, franchise-eschewing tendencies, but thanks to lively, engaging and empathetic portrayals."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,84,"keeps enough of what audiences clearly crave while also throwing in a few twists that make it feel, if not entirely unique, at least different."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,85,"Pops with the type of psychedelic, kaleidoscopic weirdness that'll have you wondering who dosed your popcorn with psilocybin... although it never fulfills the potential of its main character."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,86,"Doctor Strange isn't the best film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe canon, but it may be the most creative. (Splice Today)"
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,87,"A film that takes certain aspects from multiple recognizable sources, but adds visual, narrative and dramatic elements that differentiate it from other recent movies of the genre. [Full review in Spanish]"
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,88,"A film far more rich, entertaining and intellectual than the promotional trail of glitzy images and ambitious visual effects would have you believe."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,89,"This film has a dreamy visual architecture, mixed with a story capable of stimulating even the last fiber of the neurons. [Full review in Spanish]"
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,90,"More of the same is not necessarily always a bad thing. It's just unfortunate that it can't be something new or structurally different."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,91,"Cumberbatch is exceptionally good at playing brilliant, arrogant, isolated characters -- look at his Sherlock Holmes and Alan Turing -- and so is right at home as Strange."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,92,The big point of difference designed to distinguish this from other Marvel fare is the visuals.
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,93,"Just when everyone felt comic-book movies have reached critical mass comes, perhaps, the year's finest tentpole movie."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,94,A worthy addition to the Marvel canon.
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,95,Offers just enough plot to inspire the most dazzling eye-candy superhero movie to date.
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,96,"With Sherlock and The Imitation Game, Cumberbatch has made a specialty out of playing men who are often too intelligent for their own good. Thankfully, he hasn't gotten tired of these roles yet."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,97,"A film tinted with mischievous humor and charm, turning it into a singular variant of Marvel's ingenious dramatic world. [Full review in Spanish]"
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,98,"It's Cumberbatch who makes the movie zing. He's sardonic. He's funny. He's buff enough for the martial arts. And he fits into the movie's comic-book world surprisingly well."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,99,"Marvel's most amazing and dazzling film, with enough moments that will remain for posterity. [Full review in Spanish]"
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,100,It delivers a fun and at times even thoughtful new entry in the Marvel cinematic universe.
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,101,"Benedict Cumberbatch stars as the title character here, and it's a masterstroke of casting. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Profanity, etc. - also Available)"
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,102,It just may be the best example of mind bending visual spectacle since the first Matrix film ...
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,103,"A visually spectacular film, one of the few blockbusters of the year that doesn't disappoint. [Full review in Spanish]"
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,104,"An interesting story with excellent characters and special effects that will make me say a phrase that is already very worn (but true): they do not resemble anything I've seen in this type of movies before. [Full review in Spanish]"
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,105,A film that seems predictable until it manages to portray complex concepts in an exceptionally elegant way. [Full review in Spanish]
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,106,"A good superhero story and above average genre, I dare say, and I think it's all due to the splendid decision of selecting Cumberbacht for the main role. [Full review in Spanish]"
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,107,"Much of it takes place in the ""Mirror Dimension,"" an eye-popping universe that M.C. Escher might have imagined if he'd worked with CGI. That, plus a strong story and stronger cast makes this a winner."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,108,"Marvel Studio's latest superhero origin story is as polished and as flashy as we have come to expect from this highly successful enterprise. It is a visual feast, especially in 3D."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,109,Buoyantly entertaining.
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,110,"Not since Iron Man has a superhero movie surprised and delighted like Doctor Strange, after eight years of Marvel glut and DC rebuttals in-between."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,111,"Offers more of what's been satisfying in the movies, and something refreshingly different."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,112,Maybe you should book an appointment with Doctor Strange.
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,113,"Great fun! Doctor Strange has everything you'd want or expect from a Marvel adventure, but it also feels fresh and new."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,114,"A beat-for-beat remake of the first Iron Man movie crossed with a Windows 95 screensaver. Doesn't this stuff ever get stale to you people?"
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,115,A Marvel character fights evil in a mix of special effects and metaphysics.
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,116,...a surplus of thrilling escapism inside a movie that clocks in at just less than two hours. You wonder why it took the Harry Potter films eight films to get where they were going.
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,117,"It's a traditional fantasy journey powered in its own right by a sense of the unknowable and a star turn from Benedict Cumberbatch."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,118,"It's a refreshingly weird and a fun addition to the MCU."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,119,"""Doctor Strange"" is where the welcome wears out, where Marvel's shortcomings take center stage and play a thousand encores."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,120,A psychedelic treat for the eye and the mind.
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,121,"Spectacularly surreal, it's an awesome introduction to a fascinating Marvel character..."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,122,A wacky mystical movie from Marvel.
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,123,"Yes, we've seen remarkable special effects in the past, but the visual effects provided by Industrial Light & Magic and Luma Pictures are, well, magical."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,124,"A great score by Oscar winner Michael Giacchino (""Up"") and dialogue rife with a sense of humor, coupled with truly spectacular visuals, adds up to what will surely be a hugely popular movie."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,125,"It's straight-up Marvel superhero swagger."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,126,"Providing a finale that doesn't rely on explosions and drawn-out punch ups, Doctor Strange earns points for being a little different."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,127,"Rote storytelling and pesky politics aside, the film does offer its rewards, particularly in Cumberbatch's fine performance, some twisty visuals (many cribbed from Inception), and the occasional dabs of gentle humor."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,128,"Dull, talky, derivative, full of the usual CGI cheez whiz. Cumberbatch is the epitome of vanilla."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,129,"If it's not great storytelling, at least it's good spectacle, and that seems like the minimum these movies can provide."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,130,"Only the '60s could produce a character like Doctor Strange. [Full review in Portuguese.]"
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,131,"Adapts the Marvel character beautifully in to a fun, engrossing, and visually impressive action film all around."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,132,The undisputed stars of Doctor Strange are the kaleidoscopic special effects and glimpses of strange new realities conjured in nearly every scene.
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,133,When Doctor Strange works it does so beautifully.
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,134,"Anyhoo, Cumberbatch. A fine actor and a charming fellow. He smoothly delivers one-liners and bone-crushing astral bowling balls alike."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,135,"Action deficiencies aside, Doctor Strange is an amazing sight to behold, and arguably the strongest overall entry in the Marvel canon."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,136,"Rest easy fans, Marvel have delivered... again."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,137,"It is an entertaining action movie that features a confident lead who takes the role seriously, so you take the story about magic seriously."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,138,Doctor Strange seems to represent the point at which the art of CGI and the discipline of imagining visual images spatially seems to have reached a sublime degree of 3D complexity.
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,139,"The filmmaking isn't bold enough to fully revel in the strangeness of the source material."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,140,"It doesn't take a Sherlock to see that 'Doctor Strange' successfully sends the Marvel Universe spinning in a mystical new direction."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,141,"Doctor Strange is the coolest comic book movie of the year. Truth to tell, it's one of the coolest I've ever seen."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,142,"Affluent white guy gets knocked down a peg or two, gets rebuked by his girlfriend (Rachel McAdams) when he needs her support the most, has an epiphany at the hands of an (inexplicably white) eastern master, and re-emerges as a superhero: Doctor Peculiar."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,143,"From a whiz-bang opening sequence where space folds in on itself as combatants hurl magical fire at on another, to the charismatic, ahem, marvel that is Benedict Cumberbatch in the title role, this action film is a knockout."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,144,"There's only one word to describe, in this dismal year for movies, a superhero story that exceeds our expectations: Strange."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,145,"Weird, creative and restless, Doctor Strange is a psychedelic and fun ride that mainly satisfies by introducing a new hero to the game and expanding the MCU even more. [Full review in Spanish]"
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,146,Doctor Strange manages to expand the Marvel Cinematic Universe while also telling a satisfying story in its own isolated corner.
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,147,What Doctor Strange possesses is an uncommonly cohesive thematic and visual language for a Marvel superhero movie.
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,148,"Basically Iron Man with weaker laugh lines and vastly cooler action sequences. It's Iron Man meets Thor 2, and the thing is, those guys have met before."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,149,"Even as it closely adheres to the Marvel origin story template, it's the studio's most out-there release yet -- and that's saying something after Guardians of the Galaxy."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,150,"...the best 3-D I have ever seen...so good that I actually got dizzy . It's the special effects and 3-D that make this entertaining, certainly not the fantasy or the hackneyed story or anything else."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,151,"Even though the film is Marvel's crowning aesthetic triumph, even though all four of its stars have their game faces on and act their hearts out, even though it's got great humor and spirit, Doctor Strange isn't close to being Marvel's best movie."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,152,"Even if the story behind the curtain can't quite equal the visual spectacle, Doctor Strange will put a smile on the faces of casual and hardcore fans alike."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,153,"It's not as fresh and sassy as Guardians of the Galaxy, but it is a piquant changeup for fans who have come to find the Avengers series getting long in the tooth."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,154,"A mind-bending, exciting, funny, and, yes, strange adventure, that ranks among Marvel's best, and as a superhero introduction film is second to only 2008's Iron Man."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,155,"'Doctor Strange' is a lot of fun, but it's also unquestionably the most eyeball-popping comic book movie to come along, even being worthy of paying for the 3D upgrade."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,156,"Can the ""wizards"" behind those DC Comics movies please take notes while watching Doctor Strange?"
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,157,"Visually, this is a hallucinatory wet dream. However, like the character in the film, Doctor Strange offers a spellbinding exploration of what lies beyond the stars yet lacks the proper mastery of the mystical concepts it introduces."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,158,"...a superhero blockbuster, from the Marvel Cinematic Universe no less, for people who usually hate superhero films."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,159,"Cumberbatch, ever smoldering, takes it all in stride, managing to transform from self-serving sadist to selfless hero while maintaining a sense of command and confidence."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,160,The probability of the good Doctor returning in a sequel would seem the surest of sure things.
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,161,"...viewers will likely find themselves amused by ""Strange"" rather than moved."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,162,"Marvel's ""Avatar,"" the ""Inception"" of comic book adaptations."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,163,"There's a bunch of mumbo jumbo about sorcerers and whatnot, which weigh down the screenplay like an anchor."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,164,Kevin Feige pulled on his hyper-blade express shoes and dashed for the room...
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,165,"Marvel's most visually unique film sticks to successful franchise formula."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,166,"If only the same care that has gone into its visuals were put in the rest of it, Doctor Strange could've been a trippy, psychedelic adventure, and not a middling entry in a 14-film-old franchise."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,167,"Well-cast with dazzling visuals and production design, but somewhat dull, and it lacks enough surprises and wit to escape its mediocrity. It's lucky to have Benedict Cumberbatch who rises above the material with his charisma."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,168,"There's never been another comic book film remotely close to the Doctor Strange experience and I can't wait for the doc to make his next theatrical house call."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,169,"Doctor Strange is the weirdest Marvel film so far-and that's a good thing. But while the CGI effects are impressive, the character development is insufficient."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,170,"Just the right balance between consistency and distinctiveness, between action and wit, and, perhaps the most difficult hurdle, between magic and superpowers."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,171,"It's a slog of exposition but offers glimpses of better sequels."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,172,"See it in 3-D IMAX, people, and you're in for the hallucinatory headtrip of the year. And having Cumberbatch around really raises the bar on what's possible in comic-book fantasy."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,173,"Through outstanding casting, splashy visuals, and some unexpected (and welcome) wit, [this] is easily the best of comic book movie of the year."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,174,"Doctor Strange has a dazzling, kaleidoscopic palette that compensates for the usual thin-ish story featuring A-list actors zapping one another, along with a hero who looks fearsomely witty even in repose."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,175,"For a film that has promised diversity and wanting to move from harmful Asian stereotypes, this movie fails to bring in people of color in a meaningful way."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,176,"Doctor Strange is a solidly enjoyable superhero romp, one with the zippiest effects you are going to see this year. I just wish it was a little... stranger."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,177,"The crazy, tilted world glimpsed in the trailers is one of the most fascinating and immersive comic book-inspired film environments ever created in a live-action movie."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,178,"Aside from the dazzling eye-candy, this is a pretty thought-provoking movie."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,179,"Doctor Strange is crowd-pleasing and exciting -- funny when it should be, sober when it has to be and crackling with a magical mystique that adds a veiled layer of depth to the inner workings of the Marvel universe."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,180,For a long while Doctor Strange works both sides of the spiritual street with spectacular success. Then the film becomes what it was sending up so delightfully.
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,181,"Marvel's Doctor Strange is as surreal and psychedelic as a blockbuster movie is likely to get -- and is the best introduction to a new superhero Marvel Studios has ever created."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,182,An extremely entertaining and sure-footed adaptation that manages to conjure more than enough magic to easily pass its spell check.
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,183,"Even with the fate of the entire universe at stake, Derrickson keeps the tone appealingly light and jokey, and Cumberbatch's Strange isn't so cynical that he can't thrill at discovering his spectacular capabilities ..."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,184,"It's a mostly successful and visually dazzling introduction for the wizard, who fits in comfortably with the ongoing brand name world-building, making him a welcomingly oddball avenger."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,185,There are some genuinely stupendous action sequences here.
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,186,Is this film enjoyable? Yes. Is it the kind of film you can fall in love with? No.
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,187,"McAdams costars as Strange's fellow surgeon and former lover, and her lively scenes with Cumberbatch are worth all the digital effects and then some."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,188,"The worst thing you can say about Doctor Strange is that it doesn't aim high enough."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,189,"Doctor Strange is Marvel's most visually splendiferous movie yet."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,190,"Defiantly not your everyday Avengers movie, Doctor Strange instead inhabits the same franchise universe with an outr panache."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,191,Playful and distinctive enough to throw a wrench into the grinding gears of the Marvel assembly line.
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,192,"As a Christian allegory, director Scott Derrickson's entry into the Marvel Cinematic Universe is impressively thorough...As a movie, it's silly, sloppy, and spectacular."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,193,Doctor Strange tells a standard tale with just enough cleverness to keep the viewer interested.
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,194,"The mystical settings that this ""sorcerer supreme"" navigates make for exhilarating sensory overload, powerfully expanding on classic visuals from pioneering Marvel artist Steve Ditko. The upshot: The movie develops a distinctively trippy identity."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,195,Cumberbatch grounds the material even while levitating.
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,196,"Not strange enough; it has plenty of CGI magic effects, but lacks the cinematic magic that would set it apart from the other franchises in Marvel's increasingly crowded stable."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,197,"All in all, ""Doctor Strange"" is a fun and trippy excursion to a place where Marvel rarely seems to go: that is, to the retinal roots of the comics."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,198,"It is, indeed, strange - and that's a good thing."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,199,Doctor Strange rules the Marvel Universe. A fully realized character with dimensions. Bravo to the thousands who created the astonishing visuals.
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,200,"With a mischievous, metaphysical flourish, ""Doctor Strange"" administers some much-needed CPR to the flagging superhero genre."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,201,"In the matter of ""Dr. Strange,"" two words: Big. Fun."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,202,"'Doctor Strange' is another winning entry for Marvel. It will not disappoint fans, and those not familiar with the comic book or the character also will find the movie vastly entertaining."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,203,This is as good as popcorn entertainment gets.
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,204,"Doctor Strange likes to think it's adding a new dimension to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but in truth it's the same Marvel story from a slightly different perspective."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,205,"Doctor Strange never strays too far from the tried-and-true Marvel formula, but it's not afraid to get a little weird either."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,206,"No doubt there will be many who enjoy Doctor Strange simply because there's a plethora of action, but for those looking for the satisfying narrative foundation that these films are usually set upon, unfortunately you'll find it just a little lacking."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,207,"While I'm tired of the wretched tyranny of comic book flicks, I admit I liked Cumberbatch's picture. For the most part."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,208,"Eyeball-popping, jaw-dropping, kaleidoscopic, head-tripping---a rollicking adventure with crisp wit, strong characters and visually impressive razzle-dazzle."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,209,"So visually transfixing, so beautiful and nimble that you may even briefly forget the brand."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,210,Cumberbatch wears that Strange cape well.
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,211,"Entertaining and enjoyable even when it's formulaic and a bit underwhelming."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,212,"""Doctor Strange"" is fine, but it's as transient and unmemorable as a dream."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,213,Shows Marvel have mastered the art of the C+ despite getting wonderfully weird at times.
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,214,The first time in a while that a Marvel Cinematic Universe(TM) movie has offered anything new to look at or think about.
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,215,"Marvel is getting increasingly good at delivering great movies based on material that shouldn't really work on film."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,216,"At least the movie takes awhile before it goes into full tilt action, and even when it does, it never completely loses itself or its central character."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,217,"None of it makes any sense, but logic is the last thing any of the minds attracted to this kind of junk want or expect."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,218,"""Doctor Strange"" looks and feels almost nothing like the previous 13 films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe or any other comic book movie."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,219,"No affinity for superheroes or familiarity with Marvel mythology is required to enjoy the visual spectacle that is Doctor Strange. Being open to mysticism and the possibility of parallel dimensions might help, though."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,220,"Those reality-warping effects offer a tantalizing glimpse at how superhero movies could embrace the visual wealth of comics. If only its story, a retread of Iron Man, was as creative as the action scenes."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,221,"Watching ""Doctor Strange"" is a bit like ordering pad thai at Applebee's: It's different than the usual, but still kind of bland."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,222,"Defiantly old-school -- not the cozy, apple-scented nostalgia of the first Captain America film, but that cold, back-of-the-library whiff of eraser nubs and mold."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,223,"For a non-fan just reviewing a movie, it is, as I said, noisy and entertaining."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,224,"although ""Doctor Strange"" is often a 'been here, done that' experience, this origin story is still worthwhile because of the high pedigree of its casting and special effects."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,225,"The multi-dimensional magic of DOCTOR STRANGE's universe changes all the rules for superhero movies. It breaks from formula and leaves room for innovation and play."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,226,"Like Strange's ""mirror-verse,"" where sorcerers cast spells...without impacting our physical realm, his comic-book vehicle delivers bursts of wonder with little lasting effect."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,227,"The 14th installment in the ever-expanding MCU is the first to really exploit the possibilities of CGI -- to use state-of-the-art technology to its full, jaw-dropping advantage."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,228,"Thanks in part to its charming cast, and despite its serious intentions, Doctor Strange is a pleasantly silly film, with plenty of humor hiding amid all the reality-distorting special effects and high-flying action."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,229,"This film set the bar very high for superhero movies, something Marvel does with seeming ease."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,230,"Director Scott Derrickson and his co-writer, C. Robert Cargill, keep Doctor Strange balanced, just barely, between trippy psychedelia and plain incoherence."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,231,"Derrickson's use of computer-generated action is a strength instead of a strain, and it's not just showing off; in the context of the film, the bizarre images make sense."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,232,"You know you're in a top-drawer Marvel Comics adaptation when even the Stan Lee cameo is clever."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,233,Perhaps we might say simply that Derrickson has made a bona fide movie at a time when Marvel is only doing installments.
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,234,"Once Doctor Strange is paired with his scene-stealing magic cape, Cumberbatch's character literally and figuratively takes flight."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,235,"With one of Marvel's most indie-scene, idiosyncratic casts and co-writer/director Scott Derrickson managing to keep the wilder, trippier aspects of the plot under control (mostly), this is certainly more fun than another Iron Man adventure"
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,236,"Nobody is having much fun here. Well, except for Doctor Strange's devilish Cloak of Levitation."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,237,"For all of its wondrous world-building and trippy effects, Doctor Strange isn't the evolutionary step forward for Marvel that it needs to be storytelling-wise."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,238,"Doctor Strange looks at urban architecture through a twisting digital kaleidoscope, next-stepping from Inception to an M.C. Escher-esque action aesthetic that amounts to three-dimensional chess."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,239,"Nothing that Marvel Studios has produced can compare to the visual splendor of Scott Derrickson's Doctor Strange."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,240,"When ""Doctor Strange"" is cooking, which is mostly in its fairly breathless second half, it keeps throwing clever and goofy set piece ideas at you."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,241,Mashes up the metaphysical elements of Inception and The Matrix with a bit of superhero hocus-pocus.
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,242,Franchise Fred approves.
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,243,"Like a cross between later Harry Potter and 2001: A Space Odyssey, it might baffle younger children, but works very well on most levels."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,244,"It's a lot of fun, and commendably mind-bending."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,245,"Humorously quirky and visually spellbinding, Doctor Strange ranks as one of the best executed Marvel Comics movies, up there with Iron Man, Spider-Man 2 and The Avengers."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,246,"Doctor Strange once again proves that when it comes to superhero movies, Marvel has its finger firmly on the pulse."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,247,"Doctor Strange really does show you a few new things, or at least familiar things in a clever new way."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,248,Doctor Strange fulfills the requirements of a Marvel origin story while feeling wonderfully unencumbered by any of the franchise maintenance that handicapped Avengers: Age Of Ultron and Ant-Man.
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,249,"Any other actor in a high-collared burgundy cape and goatee would risk looking like a lounge magician. But Benedict Cumberbatch is so unmannered, so smart, so playful, he makes the title character...one of the best Marvel movie superheroes yet."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,250,"Even when the movie gets massively visual, it never gets away from the central strength of Cumberbatch's performance. That's not easy to do, but accomplishing the task is why Doctor Strange is pure Marvel magic."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,251,"The film is a strangely bizarre and brilliant departure from what we usually see from Marvel, and that's why I adored it."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,252,"While very much an origins flick, this ambitious kickoff is also, happily, a movie that wows while it makes us wonder."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,253,"Ultimately, Doctor Strange isn't so much bad as it is difficult to justify."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,254,"It is visually stunning and makes excellent use of 3D, which feels less like a gimmick and more like a vital part of experiencing the film as it's supposed to be."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,255,Doctor Strange perfectly balances its commitment to the bizarre comic book stories from which it springs with the familiar tropes of the origin story.
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,256,"This is by far the trippiest, most psychedelic Marvel film yet."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,257,"...entertains, but never haunts."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,258,A film of the medical version of Tony Stark that was more enjoyable than I expected. [Full review in Spanish]
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,259,Stunning visuals go a long way towards enlivening this largely unexceptional superhero origin story.
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,260,"It's fun to have new version of an old Marvel favorite, and a storyline which adds some genuine mysticism to this ever-expanding franchise."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,261,"The strangest thing about [Marvel's] latest feature is that all of these characters come across utterly bored with their vocations."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,262,"Whenever the action threatens to get samey or the spectacle verges on the monotonous, the film can rely on Cumberbatch's sense of fun to tide it over."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,263,"Doctor Strange gets in, tells its story, thrills you, makes you laugh, and then gets out before you get a chance to get sick of it. No stretching, no padding, no wasted space."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,264,"The film feels more programmed than written, more pre-visualised than directed."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,265,Cumberbatch makes the least immediately likable of the Marvel heroes into the most unpredictable and intriguing.
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,266,"'Dr. Strange' is the first Marvel movie to tell the reality-based version of where superpowers come from. Science takes human supernormal abilities seriously now-exciting stuff."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,267,An unconventional film with a good soundtrack and lots of digital effects filled with madness. [Full review in Spanish]
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,268,"The VFX are the best I've seen in any Marvel movie, ever. If you do see Doctor Strange -- and you really ought to -- I recommend seeing it at IMAX."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,269,"Despite focusing on one of the company's less famous and more bizarre characters, it is all too familiar for a film with 'Strange' in the title. Still, none of that stops it being thoroughly enjoyable."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,270,"This doctor, it seems, has a cure for superhero fatigue."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,271,"The film's otherworldly quality and excellent comedic moments brings to mind Guardians Of The Galaxy in terms of its inventiveness, bringing us a fresher, stranger (I'm sorry. It's right there!) version of the Marvel films we know and love."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,272,"Doctor Strange, the 14th film in the franchise based on Marvel comic books, is one of the funniest of recent times, lifted beyond the ordinary world, as befits the story, by a superb cast that includes Benedict Cumberbatch in the title role."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,273,"Cumberbatch is magnetic as egotistical neurosurgeon Stephen Strange, who, seeking to reverse the disastrous effects of a car accident, is plunged into a trippy Neverland of parallel dimensions and cosmic conflict."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,274,"Yes, Doctor Strange will change the tone of Marvel movies going forward, and that's a very good thing."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,275,"Doctor Strange could descend into a clutch of clichs, but director/writer Scott Derrickson has injected plenty of wit. The visuals, especially in the modern-world sequences, are stunning."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,276,"Spectacle is as important a character to the Marvel Cinematic Universe as its caped crusaders, and never before has this proved such a significant truth."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,277,"Perhaps it's just that there's a little too much Marvel Studios in Doctor Strange, when the strongest thing about the film are the filmmakers hired to bring it to life."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,278,"We are facing a visually unique film that will fuse Marvel's mystical and galactic sides together. [Full review in Spanish]"
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,279,"Not even a sorcerer as powerful as Dr. Strange is able to break Marvel's spell, which continues with the same kind of villains and weak female counterparts. [Full review in Spanish]"
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,280,"It's not all that strange, but it's restlessly arresting and always technically impressive. Unlike most studio franchise fantasies, Doctor Strange rewards the eye rather than assaults it."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,281,"MCU has been raising the bar on what audiences should demand from superhero spectacle. But sometimes, even they can't clear it."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,282,"If Iron Man was Marvel's infancy and Guardians Of The Galaxy the awkward teenage years, Doctor Strange, teamed with Deadpool and Civil War, shows a company growing into adulthood with its audience. The result is an absolute joy."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,283,The screenwriters gorge on pseudo philosophical pep talk as if it were white powder at an LA pool party.
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,284,"Visually, this is Inception dialled up to eleven, a world-bending, shape-shifting and time-distorting Escher painting filled with heroes and villains duelling over the possibility of immortality."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,285,"Surprisingly funny and arguably [Marvel's] most audacious film to date."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,286,"With a charismatic lead and almost infinite potential for future set pieces, it's nice to think that we could have another blockbusting dynamo on our hands."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,287,"Yes the overarching plot is a familiar one and some of the A-list supporting players get precious little to chew on (Mads Mikkelsen is particularly short-changed as the Darth Vader-like Kaecilius), but Doc Strange does the job and then some."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,288,"Like previous expository Marvel films much of Doctor Strange is devoted to Cumberbatch acquainting himself with his new powers. But the film's visual mindbending is what sets it apart from the studio's past releases."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,289,Mostly ... this is a weird and witty breath of fresh air- and as a bonus it also finds a neat solution to the excessive third-act destruction of The Avengers/Captain America films without stinting on spectacle.
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,290,Forget all you know or think you know about the Marvel Cinematic Universe. ... Derrickson has blown the glitter dust off one of its second-string superheroes and provided him with a barnstorming origin story ...
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,291,Doctor Strange is mostly a blast.
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,292,Doctor Strange does have the good sense not to take itself too seriously and there is a welcome sense of humour running through it with a string of witty asides from Cumberbatch.
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,293,"Doctor Strange boasts the most mind-bending visual effects I've ever seen..."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,294,"It's imperfect, but it's enjoyable, and it sure looks good."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,295,"[A] masterpiece of comic book cinema... part Iron Man, part The Matrix, part The Conjuring, and part Harry Potter [with] a dash of Inception, a pinch of Nightmare on Elm Street, [and] a hint of Hero..."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,296,The actors are skilled enough to make us intensely curious about their back stories and for us to accept some of their more preposterous lines of dialogue.
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,297,"Doctor Strange is all about the razzle-dazzle, where spectacle elements are good enough to save a more clunky, weightless Marvel origin story."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,298,"Don't let the goatee fool you - this is no Iron Man."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,299,Doctor Strange will obliterate your expectations. It is an enormously entertaining film; a rousing cinematic adventure loaded with stunning visual effects.
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,300,"With mystical exposition and cod philosophising growing by the minute, our senses are gratefully rescued by flashy fits of special effects."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,301,Busy with CGI to hide the emptiness where the emotional core should be. Even the mechanics of getting a man from mere mortal to demigod-in-a-cape are rote.
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,302,"Marvel Studios is becoming increasingly like Evel Knievel - with every successful stunt it lands, it makes the next one bigger and more difficult."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,303,"With viewer (and creative) fatigue setting in, to whom can Marvel Studios turn to for re-invigoration? A cocky doctor with mystical, mind-expanding powers and even more mystical facial hair? Sure, that'll kill two hours."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,304,It is not often creative ambition and actual execution rise together to such atmospheric heights.
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,305,"It becomes clear why Cumberbatch was sought for the part. He is perhaps the most gifted of the Marvel recruits... His only equal in acting facility is Iron Man's Robert Downey Jr."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,306,"However, it achieves a flavor of its own; it feels like its own unique superheroic proposition, and that's impressive in its own right. Frankly, I'd take this spiffy red cape over Clark Kent's any day of the week."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,307,"It(TM)s exciting, entertaining, goofy, and fun..."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,308,"Mind-bending effects, jaw-gaping action sequences and a cast with pedigree enable Marvel's Doctor Strange to soar through its many dimensions & parallel universes to a cinematic 3D Shangri-la."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,309,"The engrossing 3D visuals are superbly conceived, like Inception times 1,000, as buildings start to fold in on themselves, kaleidoscope-style."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,310,"The film is in some ways a triumph, but as a whole lacks the cohesion and charm of some of Marvel's other comic book adaptations."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,311,"Nimble dialogue and a constellation of capable - if mostly whitewashed - stars ensure this is a rather livelier creation than this year's Captain America: Civil War."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,312,"Doctor Strange isn't as Marvel-ous as fans would like but it sets up nicely for a promising sequel."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,313,"Weaponised by dynamic scripting, the A-class cast sell the concoction well."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,314,"Grounds its outrageousness with an undercurrent of knowing sarcasm, much like its winning star."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,315,"At long last - a light, funny superhero movie that embraces the fantasy aspects of the genre in both its story and form."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,316,"Like Inception mashed with M.C. Escher: the richly imaginative visual design is endlessly entertaining in its depiction of astral planes, mirror dimensions and multiverses."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,317,Marvel has known how to introduce a new character and significantly expand the universe in a very effective way. [Full review in Spanish]
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,318,"A film with amazing visuals, a modest script and a wonderful cast. [Full review in Spanish]"
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,319,"A purely fantastic film that reaffirms Marvel's ability to reformulate itself, maintaining an organic base for all its projects. [Full review in Spanish]"
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,320,Two hours of Strange being confused at the ins and outs of the Astral Plane would have been just as satisfying as the actual film. This is the new VFX bar to reach.
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,321,"A bizarre and beautiful detour on the Marvel journey, which culminates in a mind-bending, expectation-inverting final act."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,322,The smart script and trio of clever British thespians do their best to puncture any pomposity and there are some nice throw away lines about funny teas and wifi passwords. And yet...
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,323,"Thankfully, amid all the film's wacky-trippy bending of space and time, [Cumberbatch] manages to steer an ideal path -- taking the role seriously but allowing himself to be flummoxed by it, wittily traumatised and taken off-guard."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,324,"Director Scott Derrickson creates a cinematic experience straight from the comic books, an incredible feat that needs to be seen on the big screen."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,325,"Happily, it's [Marvel 's] most impressive visual film yet."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,326,"Doctor Strange is thrilling in the way a lot of other Marvel movies are. But what makes it unique is that it's also heady in a way most Marvel movies don't dare to be."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,327,"At its best it's a consciousness-expanding head trip of fantastic proportions, and at its worst it's merely an entertaining superhero movie."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,328,"When you add the unique visuals that a character like this can facilitate, it makes Doctor Strange one of the more interesting entries in Hollywood's 600-lb. gorilla of a franchise."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,329,"Doctor Strange is a psychedelic extravaganza that's sure to spin heads with its trippy effects and tongue-and-cheek wit."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,330,"It's a tremendously engaging and likeable superhero ride, in which the classiest of casts show they know exactly where to take it seriously - and where to inject the fun."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,331,"The visuals are worth the price of admission, but this is as generic and by-the-numbers an origin story as the MCU has ever made. It's better than 'Green Lantern,' but it will remind you of 'Green Lantern'."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,332,Fantastic and brilliant! The effects will blow your mind!
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,333,"Cumberbatch fits Doctor Strange like a pair of snap-tight surgical gloves, in yet another MCU triumph. Beautifully designed, brilliantly executed."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,334,"Derrickson promised this would be 'weird and wild', and so it is - at least within the context of a major Hollywood blockbuster."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,335,Doctor Strange is a movie very much built up of other movies yet it still manages to keep its own identity.
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,336,"""At times it will leave you in awe of what you're watching unfold in front of your eyes."""
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,337,"There are certainly shades of Iron Man and Thor, but what the film brings to the table to balance out its familiar elements is some of the most bombastic, exciting and beautiful action sequences we've seen in modern blockbusters."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,338,"Entertaining in its grand flourishes but spottier when it comes to character work and thematic coherence, the film boasts a slightly darker and more mystical air than its peers, accentuated by some of the most arresting set pieces in the MCU canon."
DoctorStrange,DoctorStrange_rm,339,"The acting, the visual fireworks and Michael Giacchino's distinctive, Eastern-influenced score all go a long way toward disguising the fact that we are once again watching an origin story, and one that seems even a bit more perfunctory than usual."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,0,"In Marvel lingo, Guardians 2 feels like a great six-issue arc, the kind of storytelling that used to be the backbone of superhero comics."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,1,"As Baby Groot's companions battle the tentacular horror in the background, we're treated to the delightful spectacle of the mini-veggie juking his way through ""Mr. Blue Sky"" in the opening credits."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,2,"Let's hope that Vol. 3 recaptures the fizz of the original, instead of slumping into the most expensive group-therapy session in the universe."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,3,"[Yondu's] presence kicks the idling movie into gear, and into a final third act for which all of the previous meandering can be forgiven - and the talk of family finally accrues the weight the film has been trying to put on it."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,4,"The reunion of the Guardians cements Pratt's mega-stardom. He has a shaggy young Kurt Russell vibe (think Big Trouble in Little China,). And Russell himself is a great addition to the ensemble, providing a dose of kick-back, kick-ass action"
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,5,"Director James Gunn has a vision and he puts it across, but it ain't pretty."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,6,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 might be a little long but the overall themes of found families and the humor remain as strong as ever.
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,7,"A wild ride that true Guardians of the Galaxy fans will love. Humor, action, and even some heart warming moments make this a must watch!"
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,8,"Guardians of the Galaxy, vol. 2 is just plain fun, a technicolor jukebox of a good time."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,9,"Polish your spacesuit headphones, crank the volume and press play on the world's first ever mixtape movie review..."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,10,"The thoroughly enjoyable return of Marvel Cinematic Universe's most wacky collective."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,11,A mixed bag leaning towards the negative.
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,12,"Women of color are either sexual objects or played off for laughs. Mantis, found by Ego and raised as his servant and 'pet', seems to be written explicitly for the film to indulge in submissive Asian stereotypes."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,13,"Yes, in many ways Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is more of the same. And one could argue that we're dealing with some diminishing returns. That's OK; it's still fun."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,14,"All in all, for someone notoriously wary of contemporary superhero franchises, I came out the hall a relatively unoffended viewer. Gunn's style just about supersedes the zip-zap-zoom, space-heavy heritage of the comic material he adapts."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,15,"It still has its wacky off-beat humour, but this time the last third came with an emotional punch, and made you like them all a lot more as they grew closer."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,16,"It's a very different movie from the first, but it still hits all the same high notes."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,17,"You will leave the cinema richly satisfied, even if it isn't quite the film you're expecting."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,18,"It's a movie about people talking, and caring for one another - filling each other's respective emotional void - just as much as it is about laser guns and punching."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,19,"Vol. 2 feels less like a sequel made to surpass its predecessor, and more like a continuation of a story. Much like a comic from your childhood, you know you can pick it up, continue with beloved characters, and escape into a world you are familiar with."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,20,"The Guardians series continues well here in Vol. 2, giving viewers more of what they expect in the unexpected."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,21,"Don't get me wrong, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is still a fun party-but it's the kind that doesn't know when to end."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,22,"These are great characters, impeccably well cast, under the supervision of a genuine auteur talent inhabiting easily the most unique and bizarre status-quo in the modern blockbuster scene."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,23,"Doesn't quite live up to its predecessor, but it's still enjoyable thanks to a cast with great chemistry. It's a group that seems to be having a lot of fun together, and that fun on screen proves to be contagious."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,24,"As watchable as a Baby Groot dancing GIF, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 merrily continues the saga of its lovable band of space rascals."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,25,"Like the array of beloved '70s and '80s tunes peppered throughout the soundtrack, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a welcome mix of the fresh and the familiar that does the job of priming the pump for another volume."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,26,"What it perhaps lacks in originality and focus is a result of a slight adjustment in priorities, and instead delivers a touching and intimate story about the nature of family."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,27,"James Gunn has pulled us in closer to this team of A-holes in an absolutely entertaining sequel that stands as one of Marvel's finest."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,28,"A brilliant spectacle in more ways than one, serving to both amp up the first film's chaotic-good energy and delve deeper into its characters"
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,29,"Beyond Groot, ""Guardians 2"" is a satisfying sequel to 2014's breakout hit full of '80s pop culture references to Pac-Man, Knight Rider, ""Cheers,"" and even David Hasselhoff."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,30,"It is a fun, enjoyable work of science fiction fantasy. Fans of these genres will undoubtably find things to enjoy with this film."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,31,"Offers creative action, a deep story, gorgeously colorful visuals, and enough characters to grow and love."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,32,"Despite the film's bloated structure, and its tendency to sway and get distracted now and then, Gunn still manages to pack an emotional punch in the end, delivering a character send-off that's bound to bring most viewers to the verge of tears."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,33,"While it may not have the novelty of its predecessor, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is hilarious, brimming with pathos, and real pretty to boot."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,34,"Like the first film, ""Vol. 2"" is colorful and full of wit and action."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,35,They kept what worked in the first volume - the music and the humor - and expanded upon it.
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,36,"The team needs a little bit of work, but the general character development, action, and gorgeous visuals make up for that. And obviously, so does Baby Groot."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,37,"This is drippy family therapy that wants you to bask in the characters' personal breakthroughs after you're done dissing them behind their backs."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,38,"For better and for worse, Guardians of the Galaxy 2 is average. And yet, to my great indignation, it still managed to move me to laughter and a few tears."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,39,"More of the same, and yet a case of diminishing returns."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,40,"I'll say it: I liked it better than the first one."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,41,"Guardians of The Galaxy 2 as a body of art/work can be added to the list of movies that makes it hard to say the sequels aren't as good or better than the first movie."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,42,"The film overall is both a visual treat and surprisingly thoughtful adventure. It's about accepting your friends for who they really are and forming family where you find it."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,43,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 is a refreshing superhero movie. It takes the spotlight and aims it squarely at its characters.
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,44,"James Gunn offers a very promising perspective in the characters' development. [Full review in Spanish]"
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,45,"[Dave Batista as] Drax is amazing in this movie. I liked him in the first movie, but I loved him in this movie."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,46,"It's still a fun popcorn ride, but not much more."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,47,"Vol. 2 is a fun diversion, and as such it mostly succeeds, even though it's not much more than a placeholder for whatever happens in the next one."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,48,"I enjoyed the humor when it landed, but the build-up was choppy, and the execution as a whole was choppy. The movie felt rushed."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,49,I had so much fun watching this movie. From beginning to end I had a freaking blast.

GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,61,Guardians of the Galaxy 2 is obviously a hell of a good time.
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,62,"At times, there's a bit too much going on, and it starts to feel like maybe we're just being set up for Vol. 3. But so what if we are? Fun is the name of the game here, and Vol. 2 has it in spades"
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,63,"Though it doesn't come tumbling off the too-high pedestal it built, it does noticeably lose its balance. It's more about managing unreasonable expectations."

GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,67,Enjoyable but half the measure of the original
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,68,"Russell and Pratt are beautifully cast - peas from the same laid-back, wisecracking, vaguely-surfer-dude pod, albeit peas a generation apart."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,69,"The neon color palette, the classic rock soundtrack, cuts to Drax and Mantis being funny-all of this works to keep Vol. 2 from feeling heavy or overburdened."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,70,"Vol. 2 is no less idiosyncratic, but it doesn't feel as fresh."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,71,"This sequel doesn't break new ground, but it still possesses much of the original's energy, fun and heart."

GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,73,"No matter how ugly it gets out there in space for our heroes, Groot is there to make it all better. And, thankfully, he does."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,74,"What makes Vol. 2 truly awesome is Gunn's willingness to indulge in the whimsy and wonder of the dazzling color of comic book frames."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,75,Reaches quite a high bar in terms of grandiose design in eye-searing bright colors.
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,76,"Gunn provides enough explosions to satisfy action-hungry audiences, and after a third-act dip, the movie picks up for an ending that tempers the obligatory mayhem with a bit of emotion."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,77,"If you enjoyed the first Guardians, you'll love the second, even if the shiny veneer of newness has somewhat dulled."

GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,86,"This new film is plenty entertaining, but lacks the complexity of its predecessor. For a movie that's about growth and relationships, it still feels like this sequel has a bit of growing up to do."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,87,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 reveals an inherent flaw in the Marvel universe-building blueprint. Getting to know these sleeper-hit misfits is much more fun than revisiting them.

GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,91,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 also serves as a reminder of why it is we keep coming back to these movies, even as we know every single time that the heroes will prevail and the world will not end: it's the characters, stupid."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,92,"Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 2 is just like your standard mixtape; it's an uneven experience filled with highs and lows."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,93,"It's as wild and wildly funny as the original."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,94,This is how you keep sequels fresh and the rest of the Marvel Cinematic Universe needs to take especial notice.
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,95,"The film, like its likeable heroes, struggles to find its own sense of significance in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and its titular saved ""galaxy"" is left with little gravity or sense of place."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,96,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is nearly everything you would have wanted from a Marvel franchise sequel.
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,97,The film is quite entertaining but becomes absurd because of the attitude of its characters making them unidimensional and causing the audience to lose interest in their conflicts. [Full review in Spanish]

GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,105,"James Gunn has done something few before him have managed: He's followed a great film with an even greater sequel. Hats off, Cheap Trick's ""Surrender"" on."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,106,"I found the plot not as tight as the first film, and the humor and sentimentality seemed a bit forced this time around. The internal logic of the plot is a bit loose, too. What carries the film are the characters, and the way they interact."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,107,The images fit intelligently with the music selection and the roguish mood makes the film even better. [Full review in Spanish]

GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,111,"It's Everybody Wants Some!! but in space and with Kurt Russell instead of Wyatt Russell."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,112,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2 is a candy-coated cinematic shot of sugar. It'll provide a short [high but] is ultimately unfulfilling."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,113,"The story, although slightly disjointed this time around, manages to offer up plenty of cosmic whimsy, zany humour and an excellent lead cast that keeps this action-packed sci-fi space-opera very much alive."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,114,"Having seen more than my share of movies where the filmmakers seem to hoping that that audiences won't notice when their craftsmanship is sloppy, it's refreshing to see a movie that invites viewers to soak in the details."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,115,"Gunn's love for the Guardians is clear, and by splitting them up and keeping the dual-plot machinations relatively simple, he has the room to explore each characters' inner motivations."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,116,the jokes and throw-away gags and irreverent potshots at popular culture and action movie clichés and hero fantasies that felt so smooth and natural the first time around here feel more forced

GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,122,It keeps the elements that captivated the general audience fresh while strengthening some of its weakest points to create a sequel slightly superior to its predecessor. [Full review in Spanish]
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,123,"It's a little bit funnier, and shows a smidgen more technical panache, than the first, but sticks to its successful formula, and therefore satisfies in much the same way."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,124,"This sequel drifts a bit into maudlin sentimentality that has no place in this particular universe, even if this installment is all about daddy issues."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,125,"Nothing [holds] director James Gunn, whose manic creativity can conjure everything from the creepy, crawly Slither to the live-action Scooby-Doo movies, back this time around."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,126,"If you were a fan of the first (I was) you'll dig the next chapter, but your enjoyment will depend on your tolerance for redundancy ... and your willingness to succumb to Chris Pratt's humor and hotness."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,127,"Starts off much like the original, but goes off the rails in the third act. No Marvel movie to date has gone this far south this fast. (Splice Today)"
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,128,"The tepid Vol. 2 survives mostly on our affection for the characters we met in the first film, but without that intro, it's a middling slog with precious little of the freshness or audacity that made the original such a standout."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,129,"The jokey demeanor that informed the first film remains, even if writer-director James Gunn forces too many gags. But the freshness of the characters remains intact, and the actors continue to interact in a manner that supports the narrative spine."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,130,"There is fun to be had as the team of renegade space pirates return...with some funny, impressive action sequences [but it] turns into a high-concept mess involving reel upon reel of planetary destruction, a VFX cliche we are seeing way too much of."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,131,"Although the fast-paced plot is convoluted, there are intergalactic battle sequences galore and lots of zany humor."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,132,"Both hard-core comic fans and more casual movie fans will be happy with the results, though parents may cringe to find Vol. 2 a bit more crude and violent than the first film."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,133,"Disney and Marvel haven't learned that less is more. Instead they subscribe to The Lego Movie mentality that ""everything is awesome,"" no matter what."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,134,"After watching all that jaunty kidcom adventure stuff, I kept getting the feeling that there was a '70's after-school special locked up inside this movie and struggling mightily to get out."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,135,"In a world where superhero movies can have the human weight of Logan (2017), you can hardly forgive Galaxy Guardians Vol. 2 for being ""entertaining and nothing more."" But while the movie lasts, the fun is worth it. [Full review in Spanish]"
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,136,"If the first Guardians of the Galaxy is about bizarre heroes developing chemistry, then the sequel is a showcase for them as individuals."

GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,141,"With ""Vol. 2"" we don't quite have that same joy and wonder of surprise we did the first time around, but Gunn does a great job of taking what worked before and giving it another spin without being repetitive."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,142,"Why should every manner of director hanker to make movies that are ""character-driven""? What a terrible phrase that is! It makes drama feel like heavy labor."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,143,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 takes everything that worked so well the first time around and amplifies it, establishing itself as one of the most satisfying sequels of recent years."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,144,"Gunn's script works overtime to repeat the crazy fun of the first part, but the plot lines in Vol 2 are clumsily manufactured."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,145,"Surprise was part of the original film's delight. But Vol. 2 cranks the volume on the formula. Plus, you know, baby Groot."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,146,"In much the same way that the film as a whole is better this time around, the performances have also improved... partly because the actors have done a better job of finding just the right approach to the material."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,147,"What doesn't work, alas, are the big things: the main story involving Peter and his real space dad, played by Kurt Russell, and the romantic ""unspoken thing"" between Peter and Gamora."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,148,"Thank you, Mr. Gunn, for starting off our summer movie season on such a high note."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,149,"Gunn's vision continues to be the most inspired of any director currently working inside of Marvel's universe, and like a dancing Baby Groot I'm pretty sure at this point I'd jive right along to any beat he chooses to lay down next."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,150,"To a large extent it's coasting on goodwill from the previous film - but the previous film established a lot of goodwill to coast on."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,151,"I am Groot! 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2' is a rousing and rollicking galactic trek."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,152,"For the sequel, Gunn has stuck to the formula that worked so well in the first film, and even if you can feel the strain of repetition, he has come up with another pert, entertaining yarn about the unshakable bonds between intergalactic families."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,153,"Overall, though, Vol 2 suffers from blockbuster bloat. Hopefully the next installment, hinted at plentifully in the end credits, will recapture the fun-fuelled zing of the original."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,154,"All sequels repeat the best tricks of their predecessors, but director James Gunn's choice of tricks is way more fun than most ..."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,155,"The most fun I've had in a theater this year and as much fun as the original. This is the kind of fun that made me love movies as a kid and is why I keep reviewing film."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,156,What could easily devolve into CGI slapstick manages to stick to the ribs in the two-films-and-counting franchise.

GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,158,"Lots of laughs, thrills, tunes in slightly lesser sequel."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,159,"How many times is it funny or unexpected to score an action/sci-fi set piece with an incongruent '70s pop song? In the first film, it was a novelty, but nothing kills novelty like monotony."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,160,"Here's hoping the inevitable Vol. 3 rebuilds some of the first film's heart, because Vol. 2 feels like hollow spectacle, however gorgeously rendered."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,161,"The fun of the movie is in the characters and their wisecracks ... Five years ago I would not have predicted that the former pro wrestler Bautista would become one of my favorite comic actors, but we live in strange times."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,162,... a functional enterprise that seems content more to repeat the accomplishments of its predecessor rather than to branch out in ambitious new directions.
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,163,"Fun, action, nonsense, classic rock, and over-the-top situations abound. Popcorn is optional."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,164,"Marvel bloat has unfortunately affected one of its liveliest properties in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 , but there is still great, snarky stuff here."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,165,"Beneath its fast-paced story, great visuals and a toe-tapping, mixed-tape soundtrack, 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2' is a story of family - in all its dysfunctional glory."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,166,"Still lively and likeable, despite the sprawling techno-bloat and general over-stuffing."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,167,"It's enjoyable and entertaining enough to earn a recommendation. I just wish the basic plot was as good as the characters. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Profanity, Sexual Content, etc. - also Available)"

GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,169,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is the first MCU film to talk down to its audience.

GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,171,"Second verse, same as the first. ... But when the first verse was as good as Guardians of the Galaxy, it's hard to complain too much."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,172,More of the same feels like less.
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,173,"There's a thin line between just enough and too much, and ""Guardians Vol. 2"" trips over that line and never gets back up."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,174,"Often loud, occasionally obnoxious and so consistently convinced of its own awesomeness that it will not, it cannot, stop pointing out everything that makes it so utterly wonderful."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,175,"The soundtrack has bigger hits, Groot is an even bigger scene-stealer, and the villain problem has been solved. But it's all a means to the heart of the story: Family. And not that Fast & Furious nonsense either."

GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,186,"Revealing the preoccupations of its maker, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a petri dish for Gunn to experiment with the idea of family as a construct."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,187,"Like ""Let's Twist Again,"" it can't play the same familiar chords with lesser lyrics and expect the same results. It isn't quite the revved-up rallying call for outcasts that the first one was, so this sequel is best approached with lower expectations."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,188,"Like many a sequel to a slam-bang, much-liked mega-hit, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 isn't quite as much fun, not quite as clever, not quite as fresh as the original - but it still packs a bright and shiny and sweet punch."

GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,193,"I'm sure you'll play it all again, Marvel. Next time, though, please give your mostly charismatic creatures a little room to breathe."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,194,"[It's] Marvel film that feels like it's playing by its own rules now that it has established these characters as runaway favorites, and the sequel definitely has a swagger that feels earned. Mostly, though, I want to tell you about how weird it is."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,195,"It's dispiriting to settle down for a Guardians of the Galaxy picture only to find you're watching Field of Dreams with added asteroids."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,196,"A $100 million, obscenely fun superhero movie packed with amazing visuals, groovy tunes, wacky action, and unapologetic schmaltz."

GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,201,"Like the classic rock soundtrack powering this picture, the hits outweigh the misses, yet there are times when one is tempted to press the fast-forward button."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,202,"The best sequel in years. Though I didn't understand the plot or the dialogue."

GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,215,"While the movie lacks the surprise factor of its predecessor, the real delight is just getting to spend time with these wonderful characters again."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,216,"Fast-paced, bonkers, high-spirited fun: a far-out space-rocket ride with a cast of endearing characters that have definitely found their movie niche and intend to hang onto it."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,217,"Vol. 2 doesn't take long to get moving, and once it starts, it just goes. There isn't a lot in the way of downtime and there aren't any moments of filler."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,218,"Vol. 2 isn't a perfect movie, but it's easily Marvel Studios' most emotional offering yet."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,219,"The sharp comic timing and devil-may-care breeziness of the original only return intermittently, and the new film's emphasis is on family feuds and forgiveness. It's heavy on the feels. There are hugs."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,220,"If you liked the first movie, well, here's more of it, only not as refreshing or original."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,221,"Suffers from being too long, but we love these characters too much to complain. Michael Rooker steals the movie in every scene he's in."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,222,"Volume 2 can claim to be bigger and better than its predecessor, although it still suffers from some of the narrative sleight-of-hand issues that kept Guardians of Galaxy from achieving greatness."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,223,"The underdog panache of the original has ebbed, and now begins the tedious world-building and brand-building that becomes necessary when you make $700 million at the box office."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,224,Overstuffed...an elephantine sequel to a movie that was lighter on its feet; it tries so hard that the strain shows all too clearly.
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,225,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a toe-tapping, eye-popping indication that summer is here, and that it might not suck after all."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,226,"In terms of sheer entertainment value, though, this Guardians of the Galaxy ultimately shares just enough with its central quintet -- rather heroically getting the job done, even if the trip from here to there can be a bit disjointed and messy."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,227,"Director James Gunn still has a lot of plates to spin in terms of plot and characters, but operating under the assumption that the audience is caught up, things feel more focused than the original."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,228,"It's stupid-smart bits... that make up for the more routine aspects of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,229,"I wouldn't call it a game changer, but a great superhero film overall."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,230,"I suppose there's a kind of genius in Gunn's ability to remember what made him laugh in fourth grade, but if your sense of what's funny hasn't grown a tad more sophisticated since you were in primary school, then..."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,231,"There's enough there to make Vol. 2 worth seeing. I just hope the creators go back to being weirder and looser in Vol. 3."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,232,Extraordinarily funny
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,233,"It might lack the freshness of part one - which, quite frankly, is almost impossible to reproduce in a sequel - but the heart and humor are fully intact."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,234,"Vol. 2 isn't the jolt that the first one was, but between all the action and its surprisingly poignant finale, it's a welcome addition."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,235,Vol. 2 is as goofy a delight as its predecessor.
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,236,"Frenetic and frequently funny, Vol. 2 moves so mercifully fast that we hardly notice the narrative potholes."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,237,"The best thing Gunn has going for him is that even when he gets off the best beat for the movie, his cast is so talented and breathes so much life into their roles that they can cover up any small dark holes in this Galaxy."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,238,"Gunn really excels in icing his cake, references to 'Cheers,' Pac-Man and ""Mary Poppins"" not only amusing but integral, much like the juvenile name calling that occurs throughout."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,239,"Loud, shallow, mindless, slightly overlong and soulless, but so what? At least it still has plenty of eye candy, a little bit of wit, and a giddy, self-deprecating sense of humor intact which makes it entertaining on a purely visceral level."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,240,"The movie does not quite reach the giddy heights of its predecessor, but that was always going to be a tall order."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,241,"Gunn works hard to deliver a sequel that delivers on the promise of the original film. There are times when you can feel him straining under the weight of expectations, but for the most part, he delivers."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,242,The acting is impeccable and the special effects are incredible.
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,243,"Though individually and as a group the Guardians don't do anything they didn't do in the first film, ""Vol. 2's"" insistence on hitting everything twice as hard soon becomes wearing."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,244,Doubles down on the things that made the first film a hit
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,245,"The first movie was such a surprise and so damn charming, that it's impossible for Vol. 2/i> to regain that feeling, but it makes its own, and it owns it. Even if it didn't it has baby Groot."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,246,Likable and irreverently funny for what it is.
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,247,"[In the end credits] you get to hear ""Flashlight"" by that original group of interstellar misfits, Parliament. ""GotG 2"" may not have its predecessor's shock of the new, but any film that introduces the current generation to P-Funk can't be all bad."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,248,"Still delightfully off-kilter, still deliciously irreverent, and still delectably scored with 70's pop songs."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,249,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 wanders, but that doesn't mean it's lost."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,250,"It's Gamora's universe and Saldana's movie, something you notice whenever it lurches to a halt (often) or you're confronted by Pratt's lackluster acting"
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,251,"""Guardians 2"" throws a lot into the pot, but it keeps all the elements clear and finds ways to have fun at every turn."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,252,"If the first one didn't exist, this one would seem revolutionary. But the first one does, and ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,"" for all its charms, will live in its shadow."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,253,"The best moments of Gunn's follow-up to his 2014 hit have an unfettered filmmaking joy - a knowing, kinetic pleasure that comes with a wink and some adolescent wish fulfilment."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,254,"All of the attention to detail by Gunn and his crew pays off handsomely in making ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" the eye candy it is."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,255,"Seeing the massive Drax coddle and protect Baby Groot is typical of their love for one another, and that translates into a ""family"" we can all admire."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,256,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 probably couldn't, and definitely doesn't, recapture the sweet and singular silliness of the original, though the new edition from Marvel Studios and Disney has its rewards."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,257,"The Guardians of the Galaxy franchise has found its little, expletive-inflected corner of the Marvel universe and it frolics there, shooting down its enemies and shooting off its mouth."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,258,"Its unique action scenes and the palpable chemistry of the lead actors continues to make this Marvel's most entertaining franchise."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,259,"Vol. 2 understands well that the action is memorable because of who it's happening to and around, and Gunn never loses that sense of character."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,260,"It's a rare misstep for the usually sure-footed folks behind the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,261,"The Guardians of the Galaxy movies are allowed to simply be movies rather than bridges to other, future Marvel franchises. It frees them up to be fun."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,262,"The rare Hollywood CGI orgy that doesn't take itself deadly seriously-like the current plague of superhero movies-and wants to be as purely entertaining as possible."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,263,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 doubles-down on everything that audiences loved about its predecessor, to still-entertaining but diminished returns."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,264,"The pivotal realization--that, in the end, using your heart beats using your head--works as a pithy instruction manual for this diverting but disposable adventure."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,265,"Already damned with faint raves (lots of fun, so likable, but not quite as fresh as the original), Guardians Vol. 2 is a better, more satisfying movie."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,266,"GOTG Vol.2 is very good at two things: laughing at its own perceived comic brilliance, and slo-mo sequences of characters walking forth to Fleetwood Mac or Cheap Trick."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,267,"Much like a classic mix tape, ""Vol. 2"" of [the series] is a movie that's similar in theme to its predecessor but feels fresh and original."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,268,"If Vol 1 was a mixed tape of great numbers, Vol 2 simply swaps out the songs with like-for-like beats and turns the volume way up."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,269,It coasts on the lazy assumption that references to 1980s video games can be the punchline to any joke.
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,270,"Much like its predecessor, Vol. 2 rests contentedly on its lush color palette and retro soundtrack to try and trick you into thinking you're not watching a Marvel movie."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,271,"As a remake [of The Empire Strikes Back] it'll do until Rian Johnson's attempt in December."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,272,"If the original was a space opera, the sequel is more like a soap opera with complicated and angry familial relationships determining the action."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,273,Enormous fun.
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,274,"...another easy-rock-scored galaxy-saving adventure whose heavier emotional content enhances, instead of distracts from, what a blast they and the audience are having."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,275,It brings the fun and is packed full of belly-laugh moments and dazzling visuals.
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,276,"The jokes are good, the music's super cheesy, but the galaxy doesn't seem in too much peril."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,277,"...aims to please with breathtaking set pieces that'll convince you to delete all your old diatribes about CGI ruining the movies. But... too many of the punch lines are referential; how much comedy can you milk from the mere mention of David Hasselhoff?"
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,278,"While Baby Groot is almost painfully adorable, it's Bautista's hilariously open-hearted Drax who steals the show."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,279,"You'll (probably) have more fun watching this than any other film this year."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,280,"This is James Gunn taking his hundreds of millions of dollars and trying something more personal and heartfelt than one might have expected from a film whose ensemble include a trash panda, a twig and a woman with antennae protruding from her head."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,281,"Gunn really leans into the old-school space opera vibe established in the first film. The music, as expected, is spectacular."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,282,"The original Guardians of the Galaxy from 2014 had a freshness to its humour and introduced audiences to a set of novel characters; unfortunately, the sequel is overstuffed with ageing movie stars trying to get a slice of the action."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,283,"Gunn's solo sequel just about manages to pull it all off again, despite a little less-than-Marvellous confusion."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,284,"Vol. 2 still has the loosey-goosey feel of a rogue epic that the kids made when the grown-ups weren't watching. Only a turd blossom could resist it."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,285,"Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 2 may not boast the same polished storytelling, but this Groot scootin' interplanetary disco once again kicks ass on James Gunn's own zany terms."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,286,"Vol 2 isn't as spectacularly zingy as its predecessor - the law of diminishing returns applies in spades to the shock power of genre-subverting cinema - but that inevitability apart, the sequel is every inch an equal."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,287,"As with the surprisingly excellent original, it's the dynamic between the cast that draws you in."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,288,"It ends up standing alongside Iron Man 2, Thor: The Dark World and Avengers: Age of Ultron as another example of the Marvel sophomore slump."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,289,"While it's perhaps a little fanciful to look for profound messages in this film, Gunn does have valid things to say about the importance, or otherwise, of family ties."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,290,It is often vastly entertaining and there is plenty of whizz-bang fun in a film that feels like a bumper edition of classic sci-fi TV - a Star Trek or Battlestar Galactica.
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,291,"If you're looking for a popcorn lobotomy, and I mean that in a good way, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 is the space comedy for you."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,292,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 amps up what you loved about the first film, but a frustratingly unfocused plot keeps it from surpassing its predecessor."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,293,"Guardians 2 zips around the universe with so much exhilarating charm and megawatt dazzle - in addition to serving up a big helping of heart - that you'll even forgive it for the few moments where it gets a bit too big and bites off more than it should."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,294,"Gunn has made an invigorating, overstuffed light show that hones itself into something rather striking by the end. And, yes, Baby Groot is pretty cute."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,295,"It's a very good sequel that can't quite recapture the greatness of its breath of fresh air predecessor."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,296,"In a perfect cinematic universe, every sequel would be like The Godfather Part II... In the Marvel Cinematic Universe, there is Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2, which coasts pleasantly enough on familiarity and a few bright new touches."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,297,"Good entertainment with specially inspired scenes, but stays below the first film on everything. [Full review in Spanish]"
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,298,James Gunn achieves a film that perfectly combines emotional moments with humor of all kinds. [Full review in Spanish]
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,299,"More entertaining, more inventive and more cosmic than its predecessor. It already belongs to the ranking Marvel's best. [Full review in Spanish]"
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,300,The best part of this second film (more will come) is also the worst: it looks too much like the original. [Full review in Spanish]
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,301,"Maybe the sequel doesn't have the freshness of the first film, but still quite entertaining. [Full review in Spanish]"
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,302,"Overall, it feels like spending time with old friends again, and the use of depth and size contrasts in the 3D is spectacular, if a lot to take in at times."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,303,"Not quite reaching the all-out perfection of the original, Guardians Vol. 2 is still a brilliantly cool addition to the MCU, soundtracked at every beat with nostalgic hooky lines and riffs, and mostly delivering on the promise of the first."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,304,"Thinks it's edgy and transgressive, the punk little brother of all those other stodgy comic-book movies, but it isn't. It's just slightly more candy-colored."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,305,"Any action film that sets its opening sequence to ELO's ""Mister Blue Sky"" can't be all bad, but the ""Guardians"" franchise will need more than an excellent vinyl collection from here on out."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,306,"The smallness of the story - it's all about petty gripes, projected as a threat to the whole galaxy - hampers the unironic aspiration to infinite wonder, which powers the cosmic reaches of the Marvel universe."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,307,"How Gunn handles the topic of fatherhood within the sphere of a big budget comic book movie is to be commended, and just might bring on a few tears."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,308,"When Guardians of the Galaxy launched in 2014, it was a pure blast; the antithesis to the morose Batman. Now, it is effectively a wake in a candy shop, where nobody knows if they should be crying or getting giddy on sweets."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,309,"The ensemble comedy formula holds true for the sequel, but this time, returning writer-director James Gunn hits the jokes with a lighter touch and makes sure to integrate the humour with the action."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,310,"Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 2 is a relentlessly joyful, heart-pounding, exhilarating slab of pure wonderment."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,311,"While this Guardians of the Galaxy has no earnest belief in its sci-fi theatrics, it believes surprisingly sincerely in its characters' inner lives, the ones buried beneath their sarcastic exteriors."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,312,"First, the titular figures were space pirates with laughs. Now, they're all of the above, but with an earned sense of heart."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,313,Doubles down on everything that was great about the first film.
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,314,[A] grand and worthy sequel that packs an emotional wallop and brilliant visuals.
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,315,"Not only does Gunn make the galaxy look like a rainbow exploding in slow motion, his still framing of particular action sequences soak in like a comic panel in motion."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,316,"While there might not be much in the way of story, there's a lot of character development."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,317,"An enjoyable ride, yet less innovative than its predecessor, mostly expanding upon existing plot lines, jokes and glitzy action sequences."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,318,This film is the epitome of a sequel to a somewhat unexpected smash hit.
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,319,"Nestling somewhere between enjoyable spectacle and excellence, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is another case where bigger doesn't always mean better."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,320,"Special cameos, bright space explosions, a kick-ass soundtrack and Chris Pratt's abs make Guardians of the Galaxy a film worth exploring."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,321,"James Gunn actually has some things to say about family and fatherhood amongst this tail of aliens, space battles and space gods."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,322,"This is the film equivalent of when your uncle walks into the room with a Sonic Youth t-shirt on, and then under bemused interrogation, he admits to having no idea they were even a band - he just likes the design."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,323,"The choice soundtrack, accompanied by the candyfloss aesthetic make for moments of fun, but it ultimately lacks the originality of the first."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,324,"The vibe is corporate, and of the most depressing kind: It's not enough that you've paid for this product. You have to sit through commercials for the next one and the next and the next."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,325,"Will everyone enjoy ""Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 2""? Of course. But if this franchise is going to survive, the producers of Vol. 3 better invest a bit more in script development and a bit less on explosions."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,326,"From the obligatory Stan Lee cameo to the also-obligatory post-credits sequences, Marvel knows its audience."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,327,"It's a shame that instead of conquering new worlds, Gunn concentrated his efforts on trying to make lightning strike twice."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,328,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 bursts unto the screen like a pack of rainbow skittles. It's a roaring space adventure with humor and heart."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,329,"Gunn's soundtrack picks also come as a surprise and work exceptionally well -- there's a scene where Star-Lord and Baby Groot cozy up while listening to Cat Stevens' Father and Son that might find you looking for a hanky underneath your popcorn tub."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,330,"An interesting experiment in telling a blockbuster story with a whole bunch of b-plots, and nary an a-plot in sight."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,331,"Still funny and fun, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a welcome return for our oddball heroes but it is a far more traditional comic book movie than the irreverent original."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,332,This Guardians finally hits the gloriously ridiculous extremes that the first adventure never quite reached
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,333,"The introduction of family bonds as a unifying theme represents Gunn's most decisive break from the original's winning formula. Aside from that, the second verse is same as the first."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,334,"It's fine, it's familiar, it's got Kurt Russell and a cute Groot so of course it'll make a motza."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,335,The motley crew of intergalactic protectors are back in this eye-popping and wildly entertaining space opera that turns the banter dial up a notch.
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,336,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 comes at us grinning from ear-to-ear for nearly two and a half hours. It's high on its own supply."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,337,"The movie will make fans happy, very happy, and it will reduce everyone else to a mass of cooing, goo-goo-ing ninnies, all in the thrall of a character named Baby Groot."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,338,"Once Vol. 2 begins, it grabs you immediately."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,339,"For the sequel, writer-director James Gunn has doubled down on all his once-nifty novelties. Strip them away and what remains is a bloated semi-mess."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,340,"At its worst, it comes across like a vulgar birthday party hosted by an indulgent billionaire for a hard-to-please stepchild"
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,341,"The cliched ""difficult second album"". Sure, the first one will always be your favourite, but you know you'll grow to love this one almost as much."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,342,"Marvel does it again in this delightful, stand-alone sequel."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,343,"Like a number of Marvel ""part 2"" entries, it suffers from the push-pull between being a smaller, more character-driven sequel and providing the required mega-bucks action and spectacle."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,344,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 answers questions posed by the first movie by exploring its cast of colorful miscreants in a way that almost makes it an anti-blockbuster.
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,345,Stuck on rewind in space.
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,346,"Where the original Guardians felt fresh, Vol. 2 now feels familiar -- sometimes pleasantly so and sometimes not."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,347,"From its huge opening sequence to the last cameo, this easily stands up to its predecessor."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,348,"The characters are still fun to be around, the one-liners are still sharp and the soundtrack is, of course, terrific."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,349,"The second Guardians Of The Galaxy is Marvel Studios near its best: spectacular, funny and with a very likeable self-mocking quality."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,350,"In the lively and unabashedly sentimental ""Vol. 2,"" our space heroes battle for their lives. But the real stakes concern how these characters make peace with estranged fathers, dangerous siblings and feuding comrades-in-arms."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,351,"Vol. 2 is filler, to be sure, but if you like the flavor of these movies, you'll enjoy this second bite."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,352,"Ultimately, Vol. 2 can't quite live up to the legacy of the first film, but it's got everything you could want from a big superhero spectacle and then some."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,353,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 exists in its own little bubble and this movie is better off for it.
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,354,"In its best moments, the movie is irresistible escapism of the highest order, a scrappy, wisecracking cousin to Star Wars circa 1977. However, Vol. 2 can cruise on autopilot for a touch too long at times."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,355,"If this new Guardians lacks the novelty of its predecessor it retains the unnerving edge of hysteria, with ever more frequent reminders that nearly all the protagonists have trauma in their past."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,356,"Despite its shortcomings, which are more about tone control than anything else, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a huge amount of fun."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,357,"If you're wondering when the picture roars back to life, it's when the enthusiastic Pratt excitedly tells his God-Father he's going to ""make some weird s***"". I assume that's when Gunn started taking his own advice."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,358,The laid back freewheeling groove disguising a remarkably smooth and accomplished ride. The design and sense of scale are dazzling sophisticated.
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,359,"It stands out more than some of the more routine films of the MCU, but whereas the first can still fairly fight it out in the top few, this is decidedly more middle of the road."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,360,"Apart from the pleasure in seeing old characters in new ways, there's also all the eye candy surrounding them. Marvel has never stinted on special effects, but this film is practically psychedelic."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,361,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 plays like a second ride on a roller-coaster that was a real kick the first time around but feels very been-there/done-that now.
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,362,"The wonderful worldbuilding, strong character work and gag-packed script make Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 one of the Marvel Universe's worthiest and most original sequels, building on the the original while not relying on repetition."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,363,"There was a lot riding on the return of Star-Lord, Gamora, Drax, Rocket and the rest to the MCU, and Gunn can be satisfied that he has delivered with Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,364,"It's still a good Marvel movie (at times, a very good one), but it's a come down from the dizzying highs of the first installment. The laughs are still there, but they're less involuntary."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,365,"Bar a few last-act wobbles and the odd tonal shift, Gunn has done it again, crafting a sequel that keeps the focus on the characters we fell for first time around while pumping up the volume."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,366,"This sequel turns up the volume on the action and spectacle for a fun and frequently thrilling ride, but can't help but feel like a disappointment in comparison to its predecessor."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,367,"There's no denying that it looks amazing. The action sequences, too, leave little to be desired as the Guardians find their footing again by working together in their own, haphazard and unique way."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,368,"Compared to its predecessor, Guardians 2 has a hollow emotional core, and the plotting feels clumsy. This movie doesn't have any real purpose, even as a bridge to other chapters in the Marvel story."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,369,"The action's great, the performances are top notch, and the soundtrack is killer. 2017's first Marvel movie is, impressively, one of the best sci-fi adventures you could hope to see. I defy anyone to watch this and not smile from beginning to end."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,370,"That sense of gooey euphoria runs through everything that's good in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2, which inches even further to the end of the limb the original Guardians film went out on in 2014."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,371,"It's fun, though GOTG2 doesn't have the same sense of weird urgency and point that the first film had."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,372,"Shot for shot, line and line, it's an extravagant and witty follow-up, made with the same friendly virtuosic dazzle. Yet this time you can sense just how hard the series' wizard of a director, James Gunn, is working to entertain you."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,373,"It's a true masterclass in storytelling, and Gunn's screenplay is tantamount to this, particularly impressive in how we understand and care for this myriad of characters - not always an easy task where ensemble features of this nature are concerned."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,374,"Gunn remains a wizard of a nearly impossible task. The ex-Troma director is ideally suited to transform what should be a hokey B-movie into one of Marvel's most audacious ongoing storylines."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,375,"The second film is far denser and has a few more pacing and story problems than the first. Still, it's a very good movie with one of the most emotionally impactful endings of any Marvel Cinematic Universe story yet."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,376,"Even the things people liked about the first movie get exaggerated until it's not cute anymore. Since everyone loved the blacklight joke, there are now constant sex jokes. Everyone loved Baby Groot in one scene, so now he's in the whole movie."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,377,"Just like the first one, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a winning and wonderfully relatable gem of crazy."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,378,"""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" doesn't claim the title from its predecessor, but that does not make it a disappointment. The first film is a slice of percussive squash-buckling perfection that it was its own hard act to follow."
GuardiansoftheGalaxy,GuardiansoftheGalaxy_rm,379,"While the sequel doesn't pack the full punch of the original, it's a wonderful follow-up that is richly dense in detail and features a parade of thrilling and fun surprises."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,0,"Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman got the tone right last time, which suggested things were looking up. But without director Patty Jenkins around, she's subject to the dismissive male gaze for which Hollywood's long been criticized."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,1,"There's some welcome levity, some genuine conversation (as when Bats and Diana share a drink), and a few moments that feel like really good comic book panels (especially mid-credits). For some, that may be enough."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,2,"A pointless flail of expensive (yet, somehow, cheap-looking) CGI that no amount of tacked-on quips, or even Gadot's luminescent star power, can rescue."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,3,"Even the strength of Superman couldn't turn this ship all the way around."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,4,A C-grade B-movie wherein all involved fully satisfy their contractual obligations.
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,5,"Everyone involved in making ""Justice League,"" and everyone who will eventually see it, deserved something better than this."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,6,"Justice League has a few decent moments and character interactions, but a scattershot tone, an odd structure, and a boring villain make it entirely mediocre and forgettable as a whole."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,7,Wonder Woman is by far the best part of Justice League! Others are annoying and forgettable and the plot is meh. But that end credit scene makes it worth a watch!
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,8,The first half of the film certainly suffers from a lifelessness and sombreness but it improves significantly both in tone and pacing once the team are brought together.
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,9,"This movie is kind of a big nothing to me...It's fine. Whatever. Leave me out of it."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,10,"Together, they combine their powers to make a movie that's objectively terrible, and yet also kinda fun. Yay teamwork!"
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,11,"I can't deny that when I saw Superman fighting for truth and justice it made me really happy."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,12,"Moments of brevity are a welcome distraction, but the film's biggest laughs come at its own expense."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,13,"Ezra Miller and Wonder Woman can only do so much to save a film of stilted dialogue, bad direction, inexplicable angles and a plot that quite frankly is boring."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,14,"Justice League is actually ... not bad. It's far from great, with plenty of flaws; it's tonally inconsistent with a muddy narrative flow and some aesthetically questionable effects work. Even so, it feels like it might be a step in the right direction."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,15,"It's the funniest DC movie, with my favorite Superman in action moment on film maybe ever, and paints an exciting way forward for the entries that will follow in its wake."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,16,"It leaves the viewer to grope their way through confused plotting, kludgy exposition, and half-baked characterization."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,17,Failure-by-committee.
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,18,"It carries a more optimistic tone than other DCEU movies, Wonder Woman aside. It's infinitely lighter and funnier."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,19,"Superhero films are no longer just superhero films-they are comedies, fantasies, heist films, spy films, hybrids of genres that work to keep the audience invested in a box-office flooded with men in capes. Justice League is just a superhero film."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,20,"Sadly, the first serving of Justice ended up being more like a buffet no one ordered."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,21,"When 'it's not that bad' is a sign of quality, it's time for DC to do better."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,22,"I think it's safe to say releasing Zack Snyder's Cut of this film will give audiences the better product"
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,23,"The creation of the great superhero team of DC Comics in the screen it's exciting but not amazing. [Full review in Spanish]"
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,24,"Like visiting a sample booth at the grocery ... a few good bites, for sure, but the ... experience comes from a stilted awkwardness that kills any comfort the food could bring."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,25,"Superman's fake CGI mouth is as an apt analogy of Justice League as a whole, a patchwork of scenes and images from a storyline which is at-once simplistic and convoluted. Very little about this film...feels grounded in any sense of reality."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,26,These great characters deserved much better than this.
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,27,Two solid hours of comic book cringe.
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,28,"[Justice League] fails to coalesce into a strong, fully-engaging story worthy of this decades-old [comic] series."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,29,"Justice League, more than any of the other films with Superman, feels like a superhero story. There are jokes and camaraderie between the characters and despite incredibly high stakes, it sheds the grim and gritty affectation that has plagued the DCEU."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,30,Justice League often feels weighed down and bloated as it constantly jumps from subplot to subplot in its attempts for fan-service and sequel building.
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,31,"I felt the pained sense of a blockbuster built by a committee, none of whom really knew what to do with this film."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,32,All glitz and glam and style with very little substance running underneath.
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,33,"It's alarming that millions of people are watching-and internalizing-this display of toxic masculinity."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,34,"Its biggest crime is being a bit too safe from a storytelling perspective, however it does its main characters justice (pun sort of intended) and that counts for a lot."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,35,"A vision of DC Comics' premiere super-team that feels just as iconic as the one that's existed in comic books and animation for nearly six decades now."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,36,"Nowhere near as bad as Batman V Superman was, but also a thousand times less interesting; scaling back and cutting out the bizarre gonzo bad decisions that characterized its predecessor but keeping all the boring corporate Hollywood bad decisions."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,37,"Justice League, seemingly a continuation of Batman v Superman, a third film in this trilogy, is jarringly hollow in comparison."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,38,"While it makes a clear effort to please the fans and the studio at the same time, it ultimately defaults to siding with the latter, and the film is worse off for it."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,39,"Justice League isn't the epic failure like some of its predecessors but it's certainly by no means a good movie."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,40,"It's fair to say that the DC Comics Extended Universe has had a rocky road on its way to the big screen."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,41,"I cannot in good conscience tell you to spend money on this film, which feels inferior to anything Marvel has put out this year and like a step backward from the surprisingly excellent ""Wonder Woman."""
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,42,"It mostly strikes the right notes this time, sending this franchise into a promising direction."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,43,"'Justice League' is both a dream come true and a horrible nightmare you'll want to wake up from."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,44,"Justice League isn't a roaring success, but it's consistently watchable, playing to its strengths with Wonder Woman and the Flash, and rehabilitating some faux pas of the past."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,45,"It's not all spotless due to the CGI and clear occasions where the [Joss] Whedon touch trounces [Zack] Snyder's, but in the end the gears do come together."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,46,"Sheds the bleak for brighter colors, bigger laughs and strong ensemble chemistry despite the atrocious CG and its forgettable video game boss villain."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,47,Justice League overcomes clunky CGI to deliver an entertaining league of heroes fans can be proud of.
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,48,"This isn't a culmination. It's a fortuitously convenient rendezvous promising more interesting plots to come."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,49,"This movie is not ready for prime time, and DC should be ashamed of themselves for letting their wind from Wonder Woman completely escape."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,50,"... but unlike its heroes that make up the titular group, Justice League crumbles under the weight on its shoulders."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,51,Makes a 180 turn by the second act and becomes an entertaining ensemble superhero movie that proves the DCEU may still have some fuel in its tank.
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,52,"The Avengers worked because everyone already had a movie...I think DC's scrambling."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,53,"A film that's even more fun than ""Wonder Woman,"" if not quite as good."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,54,"Ultimately, Justice League had some good moments and largely feels more positive and hopeful than its predecessors (the exception being Wonder Woman, of course)."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,55,"Justice League is not entirely without light, however -- there are flashes of humor and wonder."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,56,The biggest problem I have with Justice League is that it never shows us what we are fighting for.
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,57,"The DC Universe has been out-of-step since the beginning, and not even Wonder Woman can rise above this dreck."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,58,"Despite its problems, I must say I enjoyed my experience with Justice League. If not for the sheer epic event of seeing these characters interact, I'd say it would be a film you can catch on cable. I'll say see it in the cinema only,"
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,59,"A turgid film that thinks it's more important than it really is bringing together characters that haven't been given much in the way of individual support so far, making them feel tacked-on."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,60,In terms of the narrative of the film -- that feels awfully paint-by-numbers.
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,61,"As you might imagine, it's the bonding between the super heroes, especially the light banter, that makes this film an upbeat and rather pleasant experience."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,62,"With its sub-par writing, undeveloped characters, and tedious action sequences, Justice League is an incredibly misguided attempt to throw together several iconic DC superheroes that results in a dreary and monotonous mess."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,63,"On a scale of Suicide Squad to Wonder Woman, Justice League falls somewhere in the middle - not quite terrible but not exactly thrilling, either."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,64,"Although these characters are far from the heroes known through comics and cartoons, producers have understood that sometimes less is better. [Full review in Spanish]"
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,65,Ben Affleck must definitely be the worst Batman in history. [Full Review in Spanish]
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,66,The performances are lacking. [Full Review in Spanish]
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,67,The villain is meh. The plot is meh.
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,68,"It's so middle of the road, it may as well be the James Blunt of superhero movies."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,69,"But they're not enough to overcome the aforementioned Snyder-isms or the endless reminders that Earth has ""lost hope"" since the big blue schoolboy bought the farm."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,70,it makes for a reasonable amount of fun in its own right... enough to put a gentle smile on your face and look towards future movies with a little more hope.
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,71,"It's the end of the world, and we sure do know it, but in this umpteenth version of the apocalypse, I am dying from ennui."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,72,"It's an experience...the point of all of this is to see your heroes together. In the end, Justice League was a very good time for me, though it wasn't perfect."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,73,"Steppenwolf is not the most exciting villian. He's a very cookie cutter comic book villian."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,74,Zack Snyder finally hits rock bottom with this absolutely interminable trainwreck of a blockbuster...
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,75,"""Justice League"" is a mutant."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,76,"... now it's just about how bad / not so bad the final product was. [Full review in Spanish]"
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,77,Inside the film there are two visions that collide and rarely complement each other. [Full review in Spanish]
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,78,"Ultimately, what in theory could've been the superhero epic to end all superhero epics ends up having all the impact of an average episode of a live-action Justice League TV show."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,79,"It's a blast to behold."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,80,"With its screenplay by Chris Terrio and Joss Whedon, Justice League is a good balance of light and dark."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,81,"It's just a repetitive, goofy smash-a-thon that lacks the character development that made Wonder Woman so great (also a vastly better film)."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,82,"More of the same as the DC Comics superhero empire tries matching its rival Marvel's Avengers franchise with its own super-team. The results are loud, flashy and all too under-whelming for being oh-so familiar"
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,83,"It's better than average, but 'Justice League' is no marvel."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,84,"pretty much exactly what you would expect the follow-up to Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice (2015) to be, except a good half hour shorter, which is perhaps its greatest quality"
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,85,"Is it an improvement from Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice? Absolutely, but the same flaws persist, including new ones. Thankfully, the Justice League themselves are a fun bunch to be around,"
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,86,"Full of action and some much needed humor, ""Justice League"" is an entertaining two-hour roller coaster ride"
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,87,"For all the fracas, this is a curiously inert piece of action filmmaking. The dialogue borders on the cheesy with intermittent leaps headlong into the cheddar."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,88,The gritty nature of the world of DC is worth the price of admission.
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,89,"All of Snyder's DC films - Justice League included - seem more concerned with the repercussions of actions than with the actions themselves."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,90,"Ultimately, all this makes Justice League the superhero movie some fans feel they deserve but not the one other fans needed-especially fans who prefer their tales to grow with them."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,91,"It's an even messier saga than Dawn of Justice, with a tiresome and whiskery macguffin in which three magic boxes must be brought together for evil, then prised apart for good."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,92,... the Justice League works in an acceptable manner as that highly anticipated reunion of the great DC heroes... [Full review in Spanish]
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,93,"Not even all of Batman's money is able to save this disaster from collapsing. [Full Review in Spanish]"
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,94,"A hasty, disjointed assemblage of two conflicting visions; a bad movie fused to a different bad movie."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,95,"Where ""Man of Steel"" and ""BvS"" were like root canals, and ""Suicide Squad"" a brick in the face, and ""Wonder Woman"" a sweet, sweet rainbow, ""Justice League"" is merely a squandering of time and talent."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,96,"Man, oh man, does this movie look bad."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,97,"The most impressively, faultlessly mediocre and boring and pointless A-list superhero film going back through the nearly 40 years of modern superhero films."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,98,"Justice League should be seen as a step forward for the DCEU. The two hours runtime makes it flow better, and the level of entertainment is high enough as to ignore its faults. [Full review in Spanish]"
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,99,"Given the generic state of the plot and how uninteresting the characters are, Justice League wasn't worth the trouble."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,100,"... this engaging-even endearing-superhero movie in its brisk two hours is faster and funnier than both Man of Steel and the would-be opera of what could be called Batman v Superman: The Dawn of Superman's Funeral."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,101,"The characters save the film from being a complete and utter disaster, but they alone can't save it from being a mild disaster."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,102,Justice League does not achieve the impact that other films of its style have reached. [Full Review in Spanish]
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,103,"More relatable than its predecessor but no more spell-binding, Justice League races through its paces and ends: four hours of exposition and posturing stuffed in a two-hour package."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,104,"Enough of the pic works, even considering its various issues, to earn a recommendation. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Profanity, Suggestive Material, etc. - also Available)"
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,105,"Here, battles boil down to one big punch-up: bad guy pounds good guy, good guy pounds back, and so on. Rawr."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,106,"When Justice League mocks and kids itself, and the whole genre, it's way more effective than when it reaches for grandiosity and pathos."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,107,"Much more epic, entertaining and fun than could have been anticipated. [Full Review in Spanish]"
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,108,"D.C. Comics superhero movies have lagged far behind the success and quality of Marvel superhero movies in recent years. Now, D.C. is catching up in terms of replicating the Marvel formula with 'Wonder Woman' and 'Justice League.'"
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,109,"Perhaps the new Superman is closer to what the fans wanted. But he doesn't really feel like a character anymore. He, like the rest of his movie, feels like a focus group-approved concept."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,110,"The characterisation is a bit lacking in places, and the Big Bad Guy feels a tad bland, but it finally feels like the DCEU knows where it is going. Good fun."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,111,"It still achieves its two aims - improving upon Batman v Superman, and leaving viewers intrigued for future Wonder Woman, Aquaman, The Flash and Cyborg outings - but does so in a thoroughly choppy and dull fashion."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,112,"I did not have a bad time watching ""Justice League""... The problem is that it had the potential to be great, epic and exciting. [Full review in Spanish]"
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,113,"DC's superhero team-up dirge Justice League shambles into unnatural half-life with a message of apocalyptic doomsaying presented now without puke filters, so that it looks like a movie my mom watches on her television with the motion-smoothing turned on."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,114,"Although it will not go unpunished for its flaws, Justice League is light years away from the disaster that were Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and the insufferable Suicide Squad. [Full review in Spanish]"
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,115,"Most days, ""it's not great but at least it's coherent"" would be a backhanded compliment; in this instance, it's high praise."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,116,"The patchwork editing of this film matches the patchwork job Warner Bros is trying to do with the DCEU. While the result is a messy and ugly film, it successfully makes this super hero franchise finally fit right with the fans."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,117,What counts is the injected spirit; Dionysian. [Full Review in Spanish]
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,118,"Compared to previous works, the result is that of a correct League, without many surprises. [Full Review in Spanish]"
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,119,The true villain of the film is the corporate nihilism that willed Justice League into existence.
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,120,"Although engaging in parts, Justice League is one big incoherent and loud mess that, unfortunately, has failed to utilise its undeniable superhero-star power in order to deliver an unforgettable cinematic experience that the fans have been waiting to see."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,121,Justice League is just... good enough. Prepare yourself for tonal whiplash as the two directing styles battle it out.
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,122,"It wasn't evil aliens that defeated the Justice League: it was facial hair."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,123,"Justice League is flawed...but its flaws are outweighed by its superb direction, decent dialogue, and excellent casting, acting, score, visual effects, and editing."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,124,"They say that in life there are no second chances, but the jokes, the good chemistry of their lineup and the easter eggs manage to save Justice League. [Full review in Spanish]"
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,125,"Justice League is fun, or at least tries to be, succeeding most of the time. [Full review in Spanish]"
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,126,"With 'Justice' clocking in at just under two hours, it becomes the shortest offering ever in DC's cinematic universe. That alone scores major points in this little corner of the planet."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,127,"You can't save the world alone, and saving the DCEU might be even more of a challenge."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,128,"You don't get points for being able to spot the difference between Snyder and Whedon shots, the overwrought, deep-shadowed splash-page compositions contrasted with garishly overlit three-camera sitcom blocking."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,129,"It's a fun-but-awkward mess of a movie that smacks of a missed opportunity."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,130,"Like everything Snyder directs, it is an ungainly looking sludgefest of gloopy CGI and dull, dirt-hued backdrops cut with neon glare."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,131,"It's let down by almost everything -- a poorly constructed script that rarely raises a smile, direction that slows the pace to a crawl at all the wrong moments, and the worst superhero villain since the Avengers' awful Ultron."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,132,"What unfolds is an adequate answer to Marvel's first Avengers film."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,133,"Even with all its obvious imperfections, ""Justice League"" is kind of fun once it gets going."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,134,"When Shakespeare wrote, 'It is a tale, told by an idiot, full of sound and fury signifying nothing,' he could have been summarizing this convergence of the DC Comic Universe."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,135,Saved by the skin of its teeth and a few nifty edits.
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,136,"Ribbing wisecracks, courtesy of co-writer Joss Whedon, jar with director Zack Snyder's oppressive, dour approach to the source material."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,137,"For whatever reason, the creative minds at Warner Bros. and DC seem to hit a wall of kryptonite when it comes to translating their comic-book heroes to the big screen."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,138,"Beneath the synthetic sheen, bland musical cues and stock patter, there is nothing."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,139,"A significant leap for the DCEU: from downright disastrous, to merely flawed."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,140,"Justice League defaults to the problems that have plagued all the pre-Wonder Woman DCEU films, and while it offers more pleasures than its detractors would ever admit, it still qualifies as another disappointment from The House That Clark Built."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,141,"Justice League lightens up the DCEU, so at least this time, there was some fun to be had."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,142,"It's third out of five (films)... a bit of semi-forgettable popcorn-flick fun escapism and the promise of better things to come. You've got a good thing going here, DC... keep smiling - don't blow it."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,143,"With a few exceptions thanks to The Flash and Aquaman, Justice League fails to surprise and delight - the action set pieces should be cooler and the humor funnier."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,144,"Replace your skeptical lens with 3D glasses, and cheer along with your childhood heroes; Justice League is made for the fans, and if you're one, you'll have a lot of fun."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,145,Justice League is just about the most drab and lacklustre superhero epic ever made.
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,146,What was supposed to be a superhero extravaganza from the DC universe feels instead like a sloppy remake of The Avengers.
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,147,"In the end, Justice League is an enjoyable fun, if severely flawed movie that is better than the first three entries in the DCEU, but falls short of Wonder Woman's heights."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,148,Justice League. . . [is] one of those wondrous Zack Snyder extravaganzas that fulfill the aesthetic potential of comic-book graphics and achieves essential cinema kinetics.
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,149,"The cinematic equivalent of Trump and Brexit as awfulness brought upon ourselves. Incoherent and cheap-looking. There are no heroes, and everything is broken."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,150,"The good news is that Justice League is a big step up from Batman v Superman. The bad news is that it's also a big step down from Wonder Woman."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,151,"There are interesting moments when the League becomes a unit, inspiring hope that with a sequel, the gang will find time to take on the real villain around here: the person in charge of visual continuity."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,152,"It's not a bad movie, but it is far from super."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,153,"More mediocrity from DC factory. Gadot and Miller bright spots, otherwise CGI slog and cookie-cutter villain."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,154,"The contempt that Justice League has for its audience is open, unashamed, and matter-of-fact."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,155,"Feels very much like a movie made by committee rather than the fully realized version of a sole director. It's fun for what it is but also forgettable."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,156,"The action is exciting at times but the outcomes are predictable. Indeed, this often has the feel of a set-up movie, one made to kick off a series."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,157,"Snyder never lets the screen get too crowded at one time, and Justice League manages a nice balance of character and action that should make fans happy."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,158,The movie has entertaining elements and enough superhero chemistry to keep the DC wheel spinning toward the next movie.
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,159,"Every one of the many, many sky-fights, mega-booms, and fantasy landscapes on display here seems to have been purchased at an FX fire sale back in the 1980s."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,160,"... a decided improvement over the previous two outings. But that's not saying much."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,161,Perhaps there was no way for Justice League to purge the mistakes of movies past without sacrificing itself in the process.
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,162,"After the excellent Wonder Woman, DC plays it safe with a very familiar debut mission for their superhero tag team."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,163,"Much of Justice League feels slightly disjointed, like the film isn't in sync with all its parts. There are some endearing scenes here and there, but the overall result still leaves much to be desired."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,164,"Congratulations Ezra Miller, you almost singlehandedly saved the Justice League movie!"
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,165,"Now, we have a consistent tone throughout of the film, witty dialogue from the characters, a story that makes sense and every member of the Justice League has a distinguishable personality."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,166,"Formulaic, but not an artistic failure. [Full Review in Spanish"
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,167,All-star superhero adventure is uneven but entertaining.
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,168,"That this setup feels both rushed and tedious is a shame, because these figures have potential to be genuinely interesting."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,169,Justice League is first class entertainment. [Full Review in Spanish]
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,170,"It is not the worst movie this year, and it does get better towards the end. But a few smiles do not make up for the fails."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,171,"Not only does this film pull back the thick funereal drapes and let in a bit of sunshine, it even offers a couple of warming sunsets to illuminate its crusaders in the basking glow of their heroism."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,172,"Finally. A D.C. comics movie with a sense of humor. Not even Affleck's boring Batman or Cavill's less than super Superman are able to ruin this one."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,173,"The first three films in this series favored a gray, grimy look, in which the bright red and blue uniforms looked like they needed a wash. ""Justice League"" turns up the lights and brings back boldness and brightness."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,174,"There's certainly more of a sense of humor this time around with these characters and, while the end result is just a notch above so-so, there at least is a ray of hope for DC moving into the future."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,175,"If you're curious about the film but wary because of some Internet hate being spewed at it, don't let your reservations deter you from checking it out."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,176,"'It's better than 'Suicide Squad!' is not the review comic book fans crave."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,177,"Justice League thankfully leaves the punishing, exhausting darkness of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice behind and goes for a looser, more humorous vibe."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,178,Justice League is overstuffed and undercooked and features at least two too many new characters.
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,179,Justice League clears the spectacularly low bar set by Batman v Superman. Whether bare adequacy is a compelling reason to extend the franchise is another matter.
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,180,This efficient blockbuster dutifully serves up frenetic action-packed mayhem with a smattering of wisecracking irreverence but it feels awfully familiar and lacks the goofy fun of the recent Thor: Ragnarok.
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,181,"The filmisn't perfect, and with so many details and characters-bordering on the edge of clutter-is ripe for nit-picking. But on the whole I had a good time."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,182,"Dark, brooding, forgettable mashup of DC comic book superheroes not only displays zero chemistry between any of them in this corporate shotgun wedding of prized characters, it also is just plain forgettable."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,183,"Warner Bros.'s bungling of the DC comics franchise continues to sting."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,184,"An improvement over the dour idiocy of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and the silliness of Suicide Squad. Incremental maybe, but still, an improvement."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,185,"It is almost shocking how bad ""Justice League"" is. When your film makes the viewer long for the coherence and scope of 2015's ill-fated ""Fantastic Four,"" it is a sure sign something has perilously gone wrong."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,186,"It has its moments, but it comes across as an Avengers>/i> wannabe with second-rank superheroes."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,187,"For better or for worse, Justice League is the sum of all its predecessors' parts; as grand as Man of Steel, as murky as Batman v Superman, as messy as Suicide Squad, and as optimistic as Wonder Woman."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,188,"Not all the candy-coloured bombast in the world can disguise the fact that Ben Affleck, the bulkiest and mopiest Batman of all time, clearly doesn't want to be here, triggering memories of the #SadAffleck meme. Ben, we feel your pain."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,189,"A headache. A disorientating, nonsensical, hot mess barely tethered together by the digital blurs of DC Comics' heroes. These heroes appear to need saving from themselves."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,190,"The nicest thing to say about Justice League is that it won't give you a migraine."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,191,"Unfortunately, the universe might not be extended enough to avoid it."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,192,"Weary, joyless and stammering, Affleck's Batman acts more like a corporate recruiter than a caped crusader in this dull, CGI affair."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,193,"... the film is a leaden, lugubrious mess that has a few engaging moments and performances that are often overwhelmed by noisy setpieces, a screenplay that only flirts with coherence..."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,194,"It's a dismal set of circumstances, and there's plenty of director Zack Snyder's trademark moroseness and brooding. But there's lightness, too."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,195,"Justice League is not the finest film in the DC Extended Universe - that honour is likely going to belong to Wonder Woman for a while yet - but it's much more in line with an actual movie than the first three outings."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,196,"Justice League is one of those superhero films that you can't help but cheer on. Those smiles and laughs by these heroes, as it turns out, are as contagious as their frowns."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,197,"There are plenty of things to like, and about an equal number to dislike. But ultimately, its good things bumped up against the bad enough to leave me with hope and excitement for what's to come."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,198,"Justice League is a sloppy team-up film that doesn't even take time to properly introduce pivotal members of its titular team, but when you're playing a dangerous (also ill-advised) game of catch up, these are the risks."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,199,"To its detriment, Justice League constantly invites comparisons to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. If Snyder's latest inspires any passion, it will be among the tiresome, inevitable squabbling between DC vs. Marvel fanboys."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,200,"Justice League isn't funny, because it still believes it has something important to show us. It doesn't."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,201,"a weak, wonky mess with laugh out loud lines"
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,202,"When Justice League is good, it is fun and flashy and slick; when it is bad, it is maddeningly so because there are no excuses for its flaws."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,203,The only person who truly understands the right way to play a comic book hero is Gadot.
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,204,"Justice League is fixing a lot. The fixes, though, don't make for a story that stands on its own merits."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,205,"Just do one thing well, instead of trying to do six things adequately."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,206,Justice League is discordant and incomprehensible at best.
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,207,"In its final form, the new DC adventure reflects its challenging production, but it does come closer than some of predecessors to giving its iconic stable of characters justice."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,208,Tell me. Do you want to see the Justice League assemble and kick some major a**? You will.
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,209,"We've seen bad DC movies and bad Marvel movies. But Justice League is something new: It's a bad DC movie and a bad Marvel movie at the same time."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,210,"Justice League is a crowd-pleaser only if you're part of a comics-obsessed crowd."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,211,"Justice League begins and ends badly not only because of a loose script, very loose, but because the team is headed by a filmmaker of proven mediocrity: Zack Snyder (300, Sucker Punch, Batman vs. Superman). [Full review in Spanish]"
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,212,"The notion of Superman as a guiding ideal haunts these films...It's a vision [the filmmakers] recognize Superman is supposed to embody, but seem incapable of...actually realizing."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,213,"Incoherent, lacking charisma ... [Full review in Spanish]"
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,214,"While the film is wildly uneven, it's entertainment value can't be ignored, featuring some very cool moments for the fanboys to enjoy."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,215,"'Justice League' is super-charged fun!"
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,216,The movie is a clumsy steamer trunk of continuing story lines and returning stars .
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,217,"... Zack Snyder's film fulfills the task of entertaining an audience, but falls short of the high expectations demanded by a film where Batman, Wonder Woman, Superman, Flash and Aquaman are the protagonists. [Full review in Spanish]"
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,218,"""Justice League"" is pure formula. And without a sense of doom and danger, there's nothing but beefcake and banter."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,219,"... ""superficially attractive but utterly redundant"" is a pretty good description of the entire film."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,220,"This is an ODTAA (one damn thing after another) movie if ever there was one, and whether that's enough for you is a question only you can answer."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,221,"It isn't nearly as much fun as The Avengers was, but it's not a total loss either, the way Batman vs. Superman was."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,222,"At least when the heroes do get down to the business of battering bad guys, these shortcomings can be parked. The dust-up in Metropolis between the League and one familiar super-powered adversary is a doozy."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,223,"Honestly, Justice League's main problem is that it's boring, and fails to convince me why I should care... beyond the fact that they are all famous cultural properties."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,224,"Jason Momoa as Aquaman and Ezra Miller as Flash are bright spots in this fractured coming together of DC's heavy hitters, but the film takes so many happy pills it almost overdoses on them. Sometimes shadows need to fall to show us what to be scared of."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,225,"From the corporate logo depicting the iconic superheroes to the supervillain's flying robot army to the post-credits sequence, Justice League takes its lead from The Avengers, and the comparison does not flatter the current film."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,226,"As if watching listless characters exchange infantile monologues isn't bad enough, the ""villain of the week"" is a complete bore."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,227,"As with the lamentable Suicide Squad, Justice League opts for action over substance, forgoing any depth and dropping in only token attempts at humour. It's essentially one long third act, which is as deafening as it is dull."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,228,A film in which solid storytelling is neglected in favor of grandiose but ultimately empty special effects.
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,229,"If Batman v. Superman was the DC Comics film equivalent of dread and darkness, then Justice League is a look into the light, and it's all the better for its story of hope."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,230,"While Justice League endeavors to save the world -- and plant the seeds to do so again -- this is the sort of film, given DC's track record, that should celebrate small victories where it can find them."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,231,"All that said, Justice League still stands well enough on its own. It wobbles only because it's a movie -- a franchise -- at a crossroads."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,232,"Proving Wonder Woman wasn't just a happy fluke, Justice League boom tubes onto the playing field to finally challenge Marvel Studios' comic book movie dominance."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,233,"They finally got Superman right! It took two previous movies, but they got Superman right, and I'm so happy."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,234,"...imperfect but another clear step towards the DC Universe taking its rightful place as Marvel's equal."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,235,"DCEU is floundering. It needs to find a bold new direction if it ever hopes to flap its wings, let alone compete with Marvel."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,236,"Gone is the semi-pornographic depiction of muscles and male angst, and also missing is the grey-on-grey colour scheme."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,237,"As formation movies go, this was hugely enjoyable and the ten-year-old me left the cinema looking forward to the next JL escapade."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,238,"It falls to Henry Cavill and Amy Adams to bring some semblance of humanity to the unlovely material. But it's not enough to save us from the balderdash."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,239,"For all the money poured into Justice League, the effects have a slapdash, unfinished quality. Perhaps the talented FX people were too busy working on Thor."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,240,"After the undeniable failure of last year's ""Batman v Superman,"" the question was whether a good movie could be built upon the foundation of a bad one? And after seeing ""Justice League,"" the answer is that it is possible only to make a better one."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,241,"A depressing reminder that Wonder Woman was an anomaly, not the new normal. Busy and boring and oppressively computer generated, Justice League screams we're back to business as usual."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,242,Justice League successfully ushers in a new era for DC Films and delivers lots of superhero fun - at the expense of a richer and more layered movie.
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,243,"""Justice League"" is a one-step-forwards-two-steps-back affair"
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,244,"Mediocrity, thy name is Justice League."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,245,"With scenes careening into each other oblivious of momentum, tone or plot structure, it feels like a Frankenstein of a film."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,246,"while it offers little new story-wise...and suffers from the same, sludgy CGI battles that marred the end of ""Wonder Woman,"" it's better than the film it picks up from and two of its three new characters are a lot of fun."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,247,"If you can't do anything right, move so quickly that no one has time to notice."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,248,"Justice League has just enough good to combat the bad, ultimately squeaking by on the promise that the next time will be even better."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,249,"An empty mess, trying to please everyone; we suspect it will satisfy very few."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,250,"I went into Justice League with high hopes but low expectations. It exceeded the expectations, but didn't rise to the level of the hopes."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,251,"""Justice League"" has its moments (when asked what his superpower is, Batman replies, ""I'm rich."") but bottom line? It's no Thor."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,252,A movie that sets up a bunch of other movies and ticks all its boxes with brightly colour-coded markers but takes no risks and delivers no thrills.
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,253,"It's a sad day when superheroes fail to show you why they are so super."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,254,It never does more than fulfill its minimum obligations.
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,255,"Fittingly for a film that follows directly on from Batman Vs Superman, it's an ugly mess."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,256,"Justice League is fun, but in some ways a sadly missed opportunity."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,257,"Even though its main villain is terrible, the heroes are well delineated and the pace keeps the movie entertaining. [Full review in Portuguese.]"
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,258,"Justice League has jokes; that doesn't mean it's funny."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,259,"The filmmaking is just slipshod, with action sequences that swing in and out of coherence and dialogue scenes framed for maximum awkwardness."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,260,"Miller's weird, antiheroic Flash is one of the most refreshing breezes to blow through Justice League, making three years seem a long time to wait for the character's 2020 stand-alone film."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,261,"What happens with the Justice League is perhaps a symptom of muscle fatigue, creativity and ideas. The plot is simple and the fights, simple. [Full review in Spanish]"
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,262,Years from now - or maybe even as you read this - filmmakers are going to use the DC Comics Extended Universe as a prime example of how not to build a movie franchise.
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,263,"Works best when it's just letting this surrogate family bond over their mutual guilt and fears."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,264,"A film that feels so contrived, vying desperately to inject a sense of effervescence, and yet feels so forced and tedious when doing so."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,265,"If Justice League had come out in the late '90s, we'd still be hailing it as one of the best superhero films ever made."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,266,"The next time these characters band together, perhaps they will do so with stronger backgrounds, a real sense of purpose, and a story that's more than a cobbled-together mess."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,267,"The film is marginally better than last year's sour and dispiriting Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, but that's like saying that dental surgery is preferable to passing a kidney stone."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,268,"The gang is all here as DC Comics finally brings together its brooding bigwigs for a lugubrious, deafening and occasionally (but only occasionally) enjoyable team-up."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,269,A mixture of darkness and light with a certain sputter-y fizz that never quite builds into a full steam.
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,270,"When the film's tone slides so firmly back into the murk, it's hard not to see DC's notion of heroism as borderline nihilistic."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,271,"There's no getting round the fact that DC can't seem to get it together when it comes to expanding its iconic roster of superheroes into a coherent cinematic universe."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,272,"It's always engaging, and whatever inconsistencies it has - and it has many - they're all connected through fine character work and a meaningful, unifying theme."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,273,"Look, at this point you know what you're getting. It's a DC movie; it's loud and frenetic when it doesn't need to be, overstuffed with peripheral characters who don't matter and action sequences that barely register."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,274,"Justice League is no magic carpet ride, no matter how hard it strives for multi-superhero awesomeness."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,275,"But most of all, the fun came from the fact that these superheroes actually enjoyed working together and truly wanted to save the world."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,276,Guys. THEY PUT AQUAMAN IN JEANS.
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,277,"A colossal, garish shambles that offers minor relief by being a smidgen less painful than Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,278,"At least at two hours -- brief by modern superhero standards -- Justice League doesn't overstay its welcome. But like most all-star games, it's better as fantasy than it is reality. Level your expectations to the league minimum."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,279,"The good news is Justice League is not as terrible as you feared. The bad news is it's still a bloated, disjointed affair that makes little sense and a hash of one of the coolest superheroes."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,280,"The ""new and improved"" model looks claustrophobically like an over-priced TV pilot, and not in a good way. Say what you want about the tenets of brooding, art-school-fascist superhero worship, but at least it's an ethos."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,281,"... Justice League is enjoyable, smart and interesting, with touches of humour, an almost overwhelmingly high-calibre cast, and plenty going on."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,282,"The result is a horror show. A Frankenstein's monster of input and influence that knows not what to do, where to go or how to be."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,283,"""The stench of your fear is making my soldiers hungry!"" Steppenwolf warns at one point, and we have to wonder: Are they trying to provide us all with wisecracks?"
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,284,Batman and Wonder Woman are the de facto leaders of the team but what Justice League does really well is give moviegoers a chance to get to know the new characters.
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,285,Watching Warner Bros. pump out superhero flick after superhero flick over the past four years has felt a little like watching your favorite Olympic figure skater with plenty of star potential flub one triple axel after another.
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,286,"The core team is good, with Affleck, Momoa and the newcomer Fisher putting in solid efforts. But... Gadot's portrayal of Wonder Woman -- robust, athletic and kind-hearted -- saves the day and makes Justice League a team worth following."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,287,"For people who value these characters as symbols of truth, justice and the American way, Justice League never really feels like the start of something truly heroic."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,288,"People of Earth! Rejoice! The Justice League is here to save the day. Listen. Do you hear that? It's the sound of one hand clapping."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,289,"The Justice League is not without fault, but the good outweighs the bad by a mile. The characters form a solid foundation for future greatness."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,290,Overall Justice League is a fun action ride that gives us great introductions to new heroes and solid chemistry within the team.
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,291,Justice League is a thoroughly enjoyable unification of superheroes that moves at a thrilling pace.
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,292,"The DC machine has finally manufactured a product that actually tastes pretty good, even if still feels like a copy overall."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,293,"There's a sense of laying the groundwork, with new characters to be introduced, new attitudes to establish, and a new team to bring to life. On those three counts, the film gets the job done."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,294,"This must go down as the single stupidest, big-budget superhero motion picture ever unleashed upon an unsuspecting public by a major Hollywood studio."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,295,[Justice League] occasionally finds its footing but often stumbles just at the moment it should soar.
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,296,"With the stakes as low as this, it should come as no surprise that Justice League stays locked in a groove that neither overwhelms nor underwhelms."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,297,"A deflated Batman may have looked intriguing on the page. But on screen, he comes across as sleepy. Quick. To the Bat Cave. Fire up the Espresso machine, Alfred!"
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,298,"Another misshapen, boring franchise flick that may struggle to satisfy the studio, the filmmaker(s), and-most importantly-the audience"
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,299,"After the success of her own vehicle earlier this year, Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman is now reduced to rolling her eyes indulgently at jostling male colleagues."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,300,"Justice League feels like a pilot episode -- it's half-formed, overstuffed, and narratively a chore -- but at least its gotten all those annoying introductions out of the way. And it only took five movies to get there."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,301,"It's a putting-the-band-together origins movie, executed with great fun and energy."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,302,"Justice League doesn't break the formula, but it has the cast, spectacle, and characters to be elevated abiding by it."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,303,"Justice League adds wit, invention, color and warmth as it goes along, a strategy befitting a story about characters (and a world) waking up from emotional sleep and learning to take risks and care again."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,304,"But the banter has a droopy, depressed air, as if the actors know they're coming from behind."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,305,"Justice League thinks of itself as a massive event, a culture-rocking fusion of star-power and intellectual property. Instead, it's another bloated blockbuster with generic effects, stock action scenes and strained dialogue."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,306,"Now it's time for another dour Zack Snyder DC Universe movie, so bring your long face."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,307,"Well they did it, folks. DC made two movies in a row that don't suck. So... good for them. Well done."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,308,...a cacophonous mess from start to finish.
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,309,Watching Justice League feels like looking at a photo in a wet magazine.
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,310,As grey and grim as its critically maligned predecessor Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,311,"The standout is Momoa as Aquaman. Now THAT is a character I want to see more of, which is ironic since he has been the butt of media jokes for years."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,312,"Any superhero movie worth its salt has to give us something to root against. A computer-generated bad guy stomping around looking for boxes doesn't cut it, even if he is voiced by the great Ciaran Hinds."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,313,"The biggest sin a movie like this can commit is being boring. And bottom line: Justice League is seriously ho-hum, offering negligible thrills and some screamingly ridiculous plot twists."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,314,"The story is a confusion of noise, visual clutter and murderous digital gnats, but every so often a glimmer of life flickers through."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,315,"Justice League is just fine. But considering that the would-be blockbuster features a collection of A-list superheroes, the word ""fine"" is like kryptonite."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,316,"As it is, it just feels like somebody haphazardly threw several ingredients into a pot and prayed that it would work. Unfortunately it does not, merely leaving behind arguably the biggest stain on the DCEU yet."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,317,"""Justice League"" is arguably Snyder's most infuriating work yet."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,318,"This team effort feels less joyous, more uninspired."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,319,"Seeing these childhood heroes together on the big screen is an unforgettable experience. Flawed, yet highly enjoyable DCEU entry. [Full review in Spanish]"
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,320,"Justice League is by no means a classic movie, but it does enough to point towards a brighter future for the DCEU."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,321,"The 2-hour runtime mandated by Warner Bros makes the setup feel rushed, but the chemistry of the game cast, the heroic tone, and the exciting action keep Justice League afloat."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,322,"Surprisingly enjoyable... visually too dark, and it's hobbled by a villain who's a crashing bore, but it adds a welcome dose of humor to what had been pervasive grimness, and some promising new characters as well."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,323,"Justice League delivers on its action, special effects, performance, and story. It's a pleasant surprise to see a film with both Batman and Superman that isn't abominable, horrendous and dreadful."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,324,"Justice League winds up feeling so much like a straw poll for viewers, with a mishmash of everything they might want, all run together."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,325,"Facetious, tongue-in-cheek humour doesn't help."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,326,"DC fans might not like hearing this, but Justice League works most effectively when it feels most like Whedon's The Avengers."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,327,"Gadot, Momoa and Miller give this one rough parity with ""The Avengers"" movies."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,328,I am legitimately bummed out about how much I disliked Justice League.
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,329,"Fast paced & with its eye always on moving the story forward, Justice League balances frequent humor with equally frequent character exchanges & development... [A] two-hour live-action superhero cartoon made for kids as well as adults."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,330,"Justice League, overall, leaves the impression that we can finally rest easy that future DCEU movies will at least be OK."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,331,"It's teamwork that saves the day, with DC's trademark darkness giving way to a brand of sentimental uplift that Snyder, Whedon and company apparently see as necessary in our own dark times."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,332,"It's the kind of movie you don't necessarily flip past when it shows up on HBO, but that doesn't mean it's good."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,333,"A lumbering blockbuster that dilutes what's so stirring about these fabled fictional champions."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,334,"This isn't the worst movie you'll see this year, but it's by far the most worked over, which makes Justice League belong in an undistinguished category all its own."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,335,"This time, universe keeper Zack Snyder nearly gets it right."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,336,"It may be slightly better than 'Batman v Superman', but that's a low bar."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,337,"[Justice League is] an insanely fun time as it absolutely nails these DC heroes, offers up some phenomenal fan service, and promises a ton of hope for the future of the DCEU."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,338,"It's up to Wonder Woman again to save the day. And Gadot's Amazon warrior does just that in every scene she steals as the conscience and muscle of the group."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,339,Justice League is a collection of missed opportunities and flubbed ideas.
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,340,"Don't rule out the possibility that a movie dedicated to Aquaman (on the schedule for 2018) or the Flash might be fun, but the Justice League itself needs to disband."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,341,Wonder Woman whips the boys into heroes in this epic and action packed comic book spectacular.
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,342,"It dives headlong into a scrappy, Swiss-cheese plot which, while true to DC Comics' mix-and-match mythology, clumsily slaps together its disparate elements."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,343,"Justice League is as solid an outing as any superhero fan could hope, with a clear family vibe: Wonder Woman and Batman prove to be a dynamic mom-and-dad duo while the fastest kid around steals the show."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,344,"Justice League's most significant shortcoming is how forgettable it all is. There's barely a moment that sticks, not a single sequence to rival the standout superhero set-pieces of recent years."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,345,"Finally, DC's superheroes are assembled on screen at last. It's just a shame that the resulting film is a chaotic, baffling mess."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,346,"While disjointed and more than a little incoherent, gosh darn it all if Justice League doesn't end up proving to be a heck of a lot more fun than it has any right to be."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,347,"Although marginally better than Batman v Superman and Suicide Squad, director Zack Snyder's latest is still a profound mess of maudlin muscles, incoherent action and jaw-droppingly awful CGI. It is big, loud, awful to look at and oh-so-dumb."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,348,"The whole world loves these characters, and so much time, effort and money has been hurled at this property. But the story in Justice League is practically non-existent -- and, even more insulting, the big Hollywood special effects look like garbage."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,349,"It's messy and flawed but it still offers enough entertainment value (mostly thanks to its likable characters) to make it worthwhile."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,350,"After a decade of Marvel dunking on them, DC has given fans a brilliant Wonder Woman movie and a perfectly fine Justice League movie in one year, and that's the first step to a braver and bolder cinematic future."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,351,"There's a lot of loud action. There are a lot of flashy visuals. Everything goes by quickly. It's just that, like Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice, it's not a hell of a lot of fun."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,352,"These off-kilter rhythms actually lend the film a pleasant unpredictability. As does the humor, which often sits uneasily next to the moodiness, but is somehow fast and witty enough to work."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,353,These comic-book cinematic universes...train audiences to see the forest for the trees...Enjoy the trees. For the forest is a tad gnarly.
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,354,"Whedon's Avengers was an endearing accumulation of characters whose stories assembled over the course of 10 years and several movies; Justice League attempts to speed the process and blurs its appeal."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,355,"This hodgepodge throws a bunch of superheroes into a mix that neither congeals nor particularly makes you want to see more of them in future. Plainly put, it's simply not fun."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,356,"The film is, plainly stated, terrible, and I'm sorry that everyone wasted their time and money making it-and that people are being asked to waste their time and money seeing it."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,357,"Some day, hopefully soon, DC will get the recipe right again and duplicate Wonder Woman's storytelling magic. But today isn't that day, and Justice League unfortunately isn't that film."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,358,"It is the key reason Justice League is a seriously satisfying superhero movie, one that, rife with lines like ""the stench of your fear is making my soldiers hungry,"" actually feels like the earnest comic books of our squandered youth."
JusticeLeague,JusticeLeague_rm,359,"There are good, cute and funny moments that the editing team should be applauded for, but there aren't enough to distract from the beautiful, chaotic mess that Justice League ends up being."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,0,"Rogue One is largely free of the weight of myth and expectation that were borne by The Force Awakens, and this turns out to be both a good and a bad thing."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,1,"With all the aerial dogfights, armored combat vehicles, grenades, flame-throwers and snipers, Rogue One feels like a film for those who think that most Star Wars movies are insufficiently like World War II flicks."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,2,"The good news is that Edwards' effort to make a storm-the-beach war film produces a tense third act that earns most of its big moments and also justifies much of what's come before."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,3,"A a tense, well-made spacefaring war movie about a desperate and demoralized band of insurgents standing up against a rising authoritarian regime."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,4,"Audiences once packed theaters to gawk at the future; now, it's to soak in the past. The emphasis is on packing in as much nostalgia as possible and tersely editing it together to resemble a film."

RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,9,"The pace may be more slow-cooked and its tone may be bleaker than we're used to, but so much hits right on target and makes the force strong with this one."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,10,"This is a passable action movie and that's about it."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,11,"In clear rebellion from the Saga franchise, Edwards has taken Star Wars in a glorious new direction."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,12,"I know that for the next few years, at least, I'll see fewer and fewer interesting, engaging, stories, and more and more interchangeable shells surrounding interchangeable explosions."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,13,"[Rogue One: A Star Wars Story] is a full and engaging addition to the Star Wars canon, the sort of striking cinematic experience that is reminiscent of the reasons we came to love the Star Wars in the first place."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,14,"Edwards submits a distinct, though ultimately uneven work that never quite manages to become the spectacle or ensemble piece it hopes to be."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,15,Rogue One demonstrates that filmmakers can still do great things and expand this fascinating universe. [Full Review in Spanish]
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,16,"The first half felt like all action and no real character development, by the end of the film I found myself caring for the Rebel team as they undertook their last mission..."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,17,"Rogue One isn't a bad film, but it has some serious problems, which prevent it from being great."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,18,"The truth is, what Rogue One truly succeeds at is repackaging a familiar experience so expertly that it feels unique."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,19,"Chirrut's abilities borderline the trope of portraying disability as a superpower, but thankfully writers avoid offense by giving him a personality and character development that has nothing to do with his eyesight."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,20,This is the prequel we were looking for.
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,21,"Having people of all racial, cultural, and ethnic backgrounds gives Star Wars the legitimacy it needs as both a contemporary film in a multicultural world and as a space opera itself."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,22,"An engrossing tale of war showing the hearts of those who fight it, fans of all ages are likely to find a resonant story worth telling."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,23,"A truly worthy entry in the ""[Wo]men on a mission"" subgenre of war film, Rogue One roars triumphantly into theaters as one of the very best Star Wars films ever made."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,24,It may be the best suicide squad movie of 2016.
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,25,I enjoyed every minute of it.
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,26,"As a piece of fan fiction, Rogue One neatly ties into the original movie in an impressive way. But as a piece of cinema, it is entirely inconsequential and no amount of impressive special effects can hide the fact that it is soul crushingly dull."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,27,What Rogue One does differently than its predecessors is turn the black-and-white dichotomy of the Empire and the Rebellion on its axis.
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,28,"When Rogue One is following the ""cool and different"" edict, that's when it's awesome"
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,29,"The nadir of this film's cynical, marketed traipse through the iconography of its franchise is in the preposterously pantomime mythologisation of Darth Vader."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,30,Anyone worried that the Mouse House might take the edge off the franchise should take comfort in Rogue One being probably the grittiest entry since The Empire Strikes Back in 1980.
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,31,"It really puts the 'wars' of this franchise front-and-centre like never before, and what it lacks in depth and polish it more than makes up for with spectacle and grit."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,32,"It's a mixed bag of a Star Wars movie, so it's basically par for the course."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,33,"Its loyal to the franchise without ever being slavish, and it bends the established story at just the right angle, giving the saga's central conflict a new kind of life."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,34,"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is the worst theatrically released Star Wars yet. I know that many will lambast the work that George Lucas did in this prequel trilogy, but I have a soft spot for his vision with those films."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,35,"For those who grew up loving Star Wars, but have wanted the film series to grow up and become more nuanced and dangerous along with them, Rogue One does this, while still squarely existing within the design and narrative parameters of the universe."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,36,This film brings something slightly different to the Star Wars universe while at the same time giving us a lot more of what we already know and love.
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,37,"Great battle scenes, heartfelt characters, and the knowledge that there can only ever be one make this a real gem amongst stones that have, at times, struggled to shine."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,38,A surprisingly dark yet brilliantly action packed and fun anthology film
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,39,"When the action pivots on the exciting plot point of data transfer rates ... this mundane crisis doesn't seem elevated to a planetary level of urgency."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,40,"As the Rogue One draws to its utterly stunning space-battle close, it seems to feel it needs to hold hands with A New Hope - when it really just needs to pass the baton."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,41,Edwards has a keen sense of awe and little regard for the humans underfoot.
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,42,"I wanted to feel more in the trenches with these guys...but the action that was there was really good...I liked it more than the Force Awakens, and if you are a Star Wars fan, I'd say go see this right away."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,43,"It has everything hard core Star Wars fans want -- a feisty heroine, comic relief, quirky and unlikely heroes, incredible sets, and a soaring score."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,44,"There is zero depth here. You keep hoping for a transgressive moment that will make the cringe-inducing dialogue and gratuitous fan service worthwhile, but it never comes."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,45,"If you miss this point, the sacrifices of a revolution, then you will not understand the greatness of Rogue One."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,46,This is the plot-driven space opera (with delightful elements of a space western) that I wanted/needed.
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,47,"Rogue One is an enjoyable addition to the franchise and Jones's Jyn is a compelling lead."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,48,"hankfully, with a cast like this one, you're treated to a vast array of characters to cling on to. Some of them feel more like action figures than characters, but it's a delight to have characters that are colourful - in more than one sense of the word."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,49,"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is a reminder of your dreams, of the barriers you'd break to create a better world, one full of hope and liberty where the word sacrifice takes on a whole new meaning... [Full Review in Spanish]"
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,50,"While we don't have the same nostalgic attachment to Cassian, Bodhi and Jyn, that's what unburdens Rogue One, giving it a freedom to tell a story on its own terms."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,51,"It was nice to see something that was set in the Star Wars universe, but had a different tone to it."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,52,"By shifting to a higher power characters actually cry out to, Edwards achieves a rousing tale of honor and sacrifice that both deepens and broadens the rest of the Star Wars world."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,53,"When the film slows down enough for the dialogue to sink in, we realize that the story, such as it is, has been cobbled together from all previousStar Wars films combined."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,54,... the flaws in the film are in that first hour of build up the rest of the movie is really good if not great...
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,55,"While I loved The Force Awakens, it relied a lot on the nostalgia...But this movie? It could stand on its own and still be amazing."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,56,"Can I just say that I liked Rogue One: A Star Wars Story better than the last four Star Wars stories--even The Force Awakens, which was the top grossing film of 2015?"
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,57,"The action in ""Rogue One"" is extremely well-staged and exciting, and it's fun to see its small connections to the larger ""Star Wars"" universe..."

RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,61,"There are Suicide Squad-level moments of confusion, weak characters and regressive storytelling that left me downright angry."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,62,...this is a film that gives us another strong independent woman such as Jyn in the Star Wars universe and we need more of them.
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,63,"It is now a great starting point for someone new to this franchise. To quote one of the familiar lines from this space opera - ""the Force is strong with this one""!"
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,64,"This is Star Wars for adults. Well-loved characters die, the violence is gory by and large and the atmosphere is more on the lines of the French Resistance during World War II than the light-hearted thrillers that George Lucas films were."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,65,"Rogue One certainly doesn't hit all its marks. But it surely hits enough to keep holiday audiences happy, particularly as its story begins to merge with the one we discovered all those years ago."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,66,"It works more than it doesn't, and the story itself feels fresher than Force Awakens because it isn't a repeat of a previous Star Wars movie."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,67,"This is meant to be a standalone spin-off from the Star Wars movie universe, but it feels like Episode 3.5."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,68,... a reason to hit theaters this holiday season.
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,69,"... the film is mostly a triumph - heavy on the action, light on the romance, and one of the best heroines to come out of the big screen in 2016."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,70,Rogue One: A Star Wars Story sets the benchmark of how a good standalone film can be made without ruining a tight story with unnecessary sequels.

RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,72,"Rogue One captures and develops the epic yearning and philosophical difficulty of the original series' DNA."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,73,"Ultimately, Rogue One is a movie for Star Wars fans."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,74,What ought to be a raging call for rebellion sputters and coughs and then finally lapses into stupefied incoherence.
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,75,"Luckily, this is a film so rooted in the archetypal heroic quest that everyone can enjoy in varying degrees: hardcore fans, newcomers and young children alike can appreciate the rebels and their fight against the Leviathan"
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,76,"A truly stand-alone Star Wars film is worth waiting for. But a prequel this good is a first for Star Wars, too."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,77,"There's a certain weight here that hasn't necessarily been present in most of the other films. And that, plus the film's talented, diverse cast, makes Rogue One a truly unique twist on the familiar format."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,78,"Rogue One is not about people who get a medal and a kiss from the princess. Rogue One is a war film. And it's very, very good."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,79,"Rogue One starts wearing out its welcome at about the hour mark, and there's another 75 minutes to go; the movie, lumbering like those AT-ATs, feels like it stomps along forever."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,80,"This is a slightly darker shade of Star Wars adventure, for better and for worse. But it's also a refreshingly diverse collection of heroes this time, a multi-cultural crew against a white supremacist dictatorship."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,81,"Hopping from planet to planet, battle to battle, the fast-paced narrative means there's little time to flesh out everyone involved. Yet even if their characters remain sketchy, several make vivid impressions... [Tudyk's K-2SO] is a scene-stealing delight."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,82,"...for those of us who remember the prequel DVDs being events unto themselves, the overall package is a letdown."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,83,"It emphasizes the necessity of sacrifice for victory, and celebrates the anonymous, forgotten fighters who put it all on the line before that Skywalker kid even got up to bat."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,84,"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story has gorgeous visuals, including an excellent production design and great special effects, but when it comes to the narrative, there's a lot left to be desired thanks to a screenplay that refuses to develop the characters."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,85,More proof that diverse casts can actually lead to big box office numbers.
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,86,"Despite its insubstantial characters, Rogue One is an interesting entry in the Star Wars franchise, and the flawless A/V transfer of Disney's Blu-ray fully translates its aesthetic beauty."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,87,"Not all Star Wars fans will embrace Rogue One. In so many ways, though, it does fit the tenor of our time."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,88,"Did I love it? Not really. But I liked it just fine. It needed it to be much better than those best-forgotten Episodes I-III, and it does just that."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,89,"It's a movie that nails what it means to be Star Wars in seemingly every way, and it's not afraid to scare the bejeezus out of a few kids to get there."

RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,91,"Everyone gasped, shouted, and laughed throughout the film, culminating in a well-deserved, thunderous applause to one of the best films of this franchise and 2016. [Full review in Spanish]"
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,92,"A hugely entertaining film in which all of the elements fall into place so seamlessly that it can't help but make the vast majority of recent would-be blockbusters look even lamer than they already do."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,93,"Disney brilliantly executed another film in the Star Wars franchise, easing the doubts of fans and furthering our expectations on what we can expect from the films to follow."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,94,Edwards reminds us of the real reasons we love these movies. Rogue One gives us hope in Star Wars. [Full review in Spanish]
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,95,"In the first 'Star Wars' film, in 1977, heroism is rewarded (literally, in the form of a medal); but here, heroism requires extreme sacrifice. That (ultimately lethal) distinction is a key to the difference between previous chapters and this sidebar..."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,96,"As the lost piece of an intricate puzzle, Rogue One satisfyingly presses into its rightful place in the series' universe. Filling in that blank space might never have seemed necessary, but, once you've seen it, there's no denying the richness added."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,97,"Though it's certainly worth a look, ""Rogue One"" is a minor ""Star Wars"" story."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,98,"A deep cut for Star Wars fanatics,"
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,99,"This latest ""origin story"" features no storytelling development but simply repeats Star Wars formulae...Rogue One, a huckster's tale, confirms the Disney Corporation's routine indoctrination of its captive audience."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,100,"Fans of the Star Wars films--and don't be ashamed to admit it if you are one-- will see a more complete expansion of the mainline story and a lot of visual excitement."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,101,"Since Rogue One slides neatly into the preexisting plot of the original Star Wars trilogy, it doesn't feel glaringly imitative of it, as The Force Awakens did."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,102,A thrifty footnote in the Star Wars saga.
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,103,"Rogue One is fine (if you're a Star Wars fan)."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,104,Technically sophisticated and emotionally engaging.
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,105,"It's all action, hopping from planet to planet and blasting all the way. That makes it faster and more serious than anything in the series."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,106,"For a sublime third act, Rogue One is a resounding success. For the perversity of slavish desire for performers to be as interchangeable as video game characters, this Star Wars dude does not abide."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,107,"This is a Star Wars film for fans, not casual observers. It has plenty of nice touches that bring back fond memories of the original and may well be the best Star Wars films since the original trilogy."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,108,"The first act is the frenetic embodiment of the Hollywood machine, but the final 30 minutes is a rousing climactic battle on the empire's home turf."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,109,"It's already apparent that Disney's plans for Star Wars are cause for excitement."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,110,"Rogue One isn't taking any chances: It's desperate to ensure a seamless transition with Episode IV, as if this constitutes a meaningful end in itself."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,111,Yes!!!
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,112,"Apart from Ben Mendelsohn's weaselly Orson Krennic [and perhaps Donnie Yen]... the faces are unmemorable and the characters unexceptional, their meaningful glances unearned."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,113,"There's weight to this world, no longer defined by clashes between politicians and spiritual warriors; instead, there's a sense of the desperation of the people and creatures that have always existed just outside the margins of the series' frame."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,114,"Starts off slow, but boasts a fantastic third act and a very satisfying ending. A worthy addition to the Star Wars canon (Splice Today)"
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,115,"An exciting film full of heroism and redemption, that has great action scenes and political intrigues and achieves several touching moments. [Full review in Spanish]"
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,116,"It's pretty routine, but Star Wars faithful should find it plenty good enough; director Gareth Edwards keeps things moving well enough for the modest needs of the script."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,117,"When Rogue One is good, it is VERY good. When it is bad, it is... well not prequel trilogy-bad, at least."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,118,"An original story about ""ordinary beings achieving extraordinary things"" that only exists in science fiction, without jedis and Skywalker. [Full review in Spanish]"

RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,120,The Star Wars expanded universe kicks off with this entertaining yet far from flawless prequel to A New Hope...
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,121,"While there is some humor in the movie, I would have liked more of that and less of the several scenes featuring characters stoically waiting to die. I can't really blame them for their fatalistic outlook since the Empire is indestructible."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,122,"The first 'Star Wars Story' is a success."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,123,"Those with patience will find that its second half is fully rewarding, with its epic battles and grand conflicts between good and evil bearing most of the weight of the astronomical expectations that are now part and parcel of the franchise."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,124,"Earns its intergalactic stripes as a Star Wars spin-off of visual gumption and gritty action filmmaking, securing its place as the glue between trilogies in this ever-expanding space saga."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,125,... makes many of the other Star Wars films feel inferior - can we postpone the numbered movies and just tell these little big stories for a while?
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,126,"Really, this is the prequel that should have been made 10 years ago instead of that dreck that George Lucas defecated into the world."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,127,"Rogue One slots satisfyingly into the canon, pushing the franchise in a slightly more edgy, contemporary direction without causing a disturbance in the Force."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,128,"While Rogue One isn't as grand or consequential as The Force Awakens, it finds space in the margins to leave a mark all its own."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,129,"A unique and superb ""Star Wars"" adventure..."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,130,"[Rogue One] might not be as grand a space opera as its predecessors, but certainly holds its own."

RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,136,You never knew Donnie Yen whomping stormtroopers was something you needed in your life until you saw it happening.
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,137,"These Star Wars movies are pretty much the same story each time nowadays. This one has new names for basically the same characters, played by different actors...the same bad guys. How many times can they make the same movie and get people to pay?"
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,138,"While Rogue One never comes close to matching the heights of the series at its most dazzling (basically, Episodes IV and V, with honorable mention to Episode VII), it's still a worthy addition to the canon."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,139,"Not just a dull but an oppressive experience, being force-fed a corporate product: a film that never comes alive, with none of the characters properly developed, none of the relationships gelling, the very adventure formulaic."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,140,"A cleverly conceived one-off that forges its own identity with a new set of characters, a contained storyline and a kind of stripped-down tone and visual approach free of the grandiosity of the series."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,141,"Edwards appears to have elevated what could have been simply a cash-in into something that feels essential, even magical. It has the distinct smell of victory."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,142,"It's most distinctive as a stylistic departure from the original Star Wars template."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,143,"Rousing ""Rogue One"" a worthy entry in the ""Star Wars"" saga."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,144,A well-crafted and thoughtful story drives Rogue One - in a sandbox that provides a perfect blend of modern action and classic Star Wars style.
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,145,"A shot in the arm of apathy, a timely Christmas fantasy, proof of a fully-rejuvenated franchise."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,146,"This Star Wars film is functional, has strength and in one way or another contributes to the cause. [Full review in Spanish]"
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,147,"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story meets expectations, the fears of thousands of fans can dissipate, this is a worthy product. [Full review in Spanish]"
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,148,"In addition to giving us exactly what we should expect from our blockbuster event-movies, ""Rogue One"" means we've only just begun to explore this galaxy far, far away."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,149,"The stars are gone, much of the spirit has been lost, leaving only a lot more wars. So this is a space-faring, big-screen computer game with hoards of Stormtroopers."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,150,"Even if it's not great, it is a quality sci-fi film that won't disappoint its fan base."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,151,"It's a giant universe out there, but in these movies it just keeps getting smaller."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,152,"Explosive action, interesting characters and a compelling story make this stand-alone movie in the Star Wars universe a winner all the way."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,153,Fans will be happy.
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,154,Rogue One is at its best when it explores the relationship between the characters at ground level. They are a scrappy lot with a lot of heart.
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,155,"These disparate elements do not come together to make a cohesive whole. At times, Rogue One feels like a rehash of previous Star Wars films, only with newer faces."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,156,"Jyn represents a new breed of (almost gender-neutral) hero: dogged, tenacious, resolute. And in a world as bleak as this one, that's what amounts to hope."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,157,"Its characters are largely new, which means the movie can do with them as it wants. It isn't hemmed in the way most prequels are."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,158,"Rogue One does a brilliant job capturing the look and feel of Star Wars, but narratively, it's a footnote, and some of the creative choices are baffling."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,159,"Much of Rogue One is a push-me pull-you with George Lucas' original films."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,160,Rogue One feels more like a movie with Star Wars stuff in it than an actual Star Wars movie.
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,161,"Rogue One is set a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, yet feels more immediate, even prescient, than any Hollywood film in recent memory."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,162,"Rogue one is the Star Wars film, that as an adult (who grew up with the originals), I've always wanted to see. [Full review in Spanish]"
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,163,"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is a film that remains fun thanks to its rich universe, spectacular set pieces and superb supporting cast, while still being held back from achieving the same excellence as its predecessor."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,164,Rogue One sure pulls no punches and it is a gritty war picture that perfectly captures a galaxy ruled and impoverished by the tyranny of the cold and clinical Empire.
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,165,"Let's get this out of the way -- Rogue One is the best Star Wars film since The Empire Strikes Back."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,166,"Ben Mendelsohn is satisfyingly nasty as the film's principal villain, and while I'd like to have seen a little more of Mads Mikkelsen, an ensemble cast of proper actors gives the film authenticity, and grit."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,167,...an attempt to squeeze one more movie out of a used MacGuffin.
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,168,I believe devoted Star Wars fans will be thrilled with the intense Rogue One. I liked it okay.
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,169,"The studios announced that Rogue One will be a stand-alone affair without any sequels or spin-offs, which is just as well. There's nothing here that's worth carrying into future movies."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,170,"It ranks among the series' best -- just below A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back (Episodes IV and V), and just above The Force Awakens."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,171,"From a visual standpoint it's stunning, as the production values are a real knockout. Plus the battle scenes are really well executed. That said the plot is not always that engaging."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,172,"This off-shoot is a heck of a fun science-fiction film, and the last third of the movie is a wild, epic battle."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,173,"Suffice it to say, if the filmmakers had actually put up this tangle of a screenplay to K-2SO to rate his opinion, it wouldn't have been encouraging."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,174,"As rousing as it is respectful, carving out its own path while playing within the boundaries of the previous blockbusters, this is one of the best Star Wars stories ever put to film"
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,175,"Maybe its modesty is the key to the success of ""Rogue One,"" that it doesn't seek to build on the mythology of the other seven films, but simply fill in a gap."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,176,"Epic but violent adventure offers diversity, role models."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,177,"The 2:13 length and cookie cutter characters and events suck the life out of an underwhelming story. Great effects but the Force just isn't with this one."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,178,"This standalone prequel/sequel takes a few beats to get going but once it does, Star Wars fans are taken on an intense, thrilling ride."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,179,"Trading emotion and depth for sci-fi magic and bombast, Rogue One is the start of a darker, more grown-up direction for the saga, and I applaud it."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,180,"There's genuine fun here, but the humor is cynical, the heroics are tinged with regret, and it's all delivered with a cold smack of - yes - political relevance."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,181,"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is thrilling, harrowing, and slightly rushed, a beautifully shot film that could have given its characters more time to develop."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,182,"If you've ever wondered where Princess Leia got those Death Star plans from, well, here you go. Hope I'm not spoiling anything."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,183,The best Star Wars movie ever by a longshot.
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,184,"I had a bad feeling about this, but Rogue One proves it belongs in the Star Wars universe."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,185,"Stylistic touches and new characters make 'Rogue One' seem fresh, which also invigorates the ongoing franchise."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,186,"We must trust this series, a series that made us fall in love with scruffy-looking nerf herders, trigger happy fuzzballs and pessimistic droids. We must trust the Force."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,187,"By the note-perfect closing moments, ""Rogue One"" has transformed into a richly rewarding experience."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,188,"As we rebels prepare to fight the empire of Trump, the film is more pertinent than ever."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,189,"The Force is with ""Rogue One"" because by looking back, it helps carry the ""Star Wars"" saga forward."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,190,"Rogue One is technically a spin-off but it is a rip-roaring, do-or-die adventure yarn in the best tradition of the space-age saga."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,191,"Gareth Edwards has expanded his story to its maximum while keeping it lean, raw and morally murky, outdoing The Force Awakens in the most satisfying installment since The Empire Strikes Back."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,192,A seriously rousing action film with a riveting cast of characters and a surprising willingness to embrace even the darkest elements of storytelling.
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,193,"With strong work from Jones, Luna, Mikkelsen and Mendelsohn, a handful of exciting set-pieces... and plenty of expensive CG (surprise, surprise), this still doesn't quite work as the epic it so wants to be."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,194,"There's a sense of familiarity and a refreshing sense of being offered something we haven't quite seen before, and that Rogue One is actually entertaining about it makes the experience all the sweeter."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,195,"The film isn't as excting as Episode VII, but there are a few reasons to get excited about it: the incredible stages, Death troopers and a pair of cameos that serve as anchor to this universe. [Full review in Spanish]"
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,196,"With amazing battles that live up to the original saga, this film is more than a close relative worthy of Star Wars. [Full review in Spanish]"
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,197,"As a prequel, it brings depth and strength to the existing canon, and Rogue One: A Star Wars Story will probably leave fans wishing it could have spun off into a franchise of its own."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,198,"It's a film that should further the genuine sense of excitement surrounding this particular franchise revival, while standing as something of a classic in its own right."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,199,The Force is strong in this spin-off.
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,200,Rogue Ones establishes its own identity while fitting perfectly in the Star Wars universe. [Full review in Portuguese.]
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,201,"We're used to the characters in this series existing primarily as archetypes. The characters here, though, barely qualify as archetypes."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,202,"This is the Star Wars film to be excited for since a galaxy far, far away has never looked as promising as it does now. Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is everything The Force Awakens should have been and then some."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,203,"Certainly there is pleasure in revisiting a favorite place you've been many times before. But it's not an 'event' film. For the first time, it really does just feel like an episode."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,204,Rogue One finds a way to forge its own path.
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,205,"A film with amazing performances and an absolutely memorable ending, where action, emotion, joy and sadness embrace in a totemic spectacle. [Full review in Spanish]"
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,206,"[Gareth Edwards'] technical vision shines through in the battle scenes, but his work with actors leaves something to be desired"
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,207,[A]n eye-popping heart-stopping joyride that leaves you breathless... a grand and operatic vision...
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,208,"Edwards pushes the saga out of its comfort zone to offer a complex look at the universe created by George Lucas, making it truly feel diverse and complicated. [Full review in Spanish]"
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,209,"Sadly, that Felicity Jones isn't a standout as Rogue One's lead speaks to how more effort seems to have been spent on fan service than character development..."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,210,A fun ride that repeats the Star Wars legacy without really adding to it.
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,211,"It's an enthralling go, with little pops of surprise and revelation that should please, nostalgically so."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,212,An energetic and very surprising film from the galactic saga with the very successful and simple resource of telling the same story. [Full review in Spanish]
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,213,"Rogue One may be more intense than fun, but it's the best Star Wars prequel film by a long shot."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,214,Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is what the fans expected and more. [Full review in Spanish]
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,215,A serious and occasionally spectacular addition to the Star Wars universe that only suffers in comparison to the original saga when measured by the charisma and likability of its characters.
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,216,"Action-packed and glorious in its engaging and often times, exotic dimensions of storytelling is absolutely stirring."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,217,This is a movie made for fans.
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,218,"Tudyk's K-2S0 has in miniature what Edwards's movie lacks overall: the soul of a new machine."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,219,Star Wars Wars is such an immersive world heavy in lore and esoteric facts that being able to balance fan service without scaring off the casual moviegoer is no easy feat. Rogue One: A Star Wars Story manages to do exactly that.
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,220,"It's a real shame the character side of things is so weak, because otherwise this is a strong addition to the franchise."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,221,"Some sci-fi/fantasy fans may wonder if every last drop has already been milked out of the Star Wars franchise. But, judging from this energetic standalone tangent/prequel, more can be exploited for many years to come."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,222,"[K-2SO] has all the good lines. I'm not sure if it's such a good thing that the best character in a sci-fi movie is a robot. But then again, the best character in 2001: A Space Odyssey was HAL, and that film wasn't half-bad."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,223,"Except for a few jocose, fan-serving moments, the movie is a dour affair, lacking the charm and chills of J.J. Abrams's spirited Star Wars: The Force Awakens, not to mention George Lucas's founding trilogy."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,224,"Like an Imperial Star Destroyer, it starts off slow and somewhat clunky, but by the time the mind-blowing third act arrives, it's all a fan can do not to stand up and cheer."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,225,"Often it looks dingy and cheap. Speed of action ought to compensate. But when the action is standardised chases-through-space, turgid and repetitive, that doesn't compensate for anything."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,226,"[Rogue One] is sometimes as admirable as it is enjoyable, but it also has some glaring problems that are clearly holding the movie back from reaching its full potential."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,227,"This prequel delivers more levels than the Death Star's elevator."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,228,"One of the most exhilarating in the series, a film with a real sense of how to tell a story - and tell it well."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,229,"Familiar Star Wars action scenarios are revisited, revamped and revitalised courtesy of bleeding edge effects and genuine love for the material."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,230,Rogue One does a great job of walking the fine line between being a Star Wars film and not feeling like any other Star Wars film.
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,231,"A highly entertaining mess...the kind of loopy, stumblebum spectacle you get when state-of-the-art visual effects collide head-on with the erratic sensibilities of a resolutely mediocre director and the crushing need for a studio to meet a release date."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,232,The rebel yell is a little croaky.
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,233,"It also works as its own stand-alone film. One which, despite some lumpy pacing in its first half, turns out to be possibly the best Star Wars war film of the bunch."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,234,Rogue One works best because its story is so narrowly focused.
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,235,"Rogue One is an explosive, brilliant entry into the Star Wars universe. It's a bracing slap in the face, but a bloody fun one to watch."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,236,"The good news is that it's something genuinely fresh, a Star Wars story unlike any big screen adventure yet."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,237,"In short, this movie is what the Star Wars prequels should have been, and that's meant as high praise indeed."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,238,"The resonant and entertaining Rogue One is about the persistence of hope and faith in the darkest of hours. As we stagger to the end of this epically turbulent year, the movie is all but guaranteed to strike a chord."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,239,"Efficiently made...but it comes across as an assembly-line product, an elaborate but fairly conventional action-adventure movie too dependent for its effect on references to earlier entries in the series."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,240,"That's what people love about these Star Wars movies, right? We get older, they stay the same."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,241,Rogue One packs an emotional punch and shows much promise for stories to come from a rich universe with an astonishing cultural impact.
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,242,"Dark, gritty and heavy on the nostalgia, what Rogue One lacks in dialogue it makes up for in action."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,243,a boots-on-the-ground war story about flawed and forgotten heroes
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,244,"The performances in this film are among the best the franchise has seen. This isn't a film of supermen. It's one of everyday people trying to justify, morally and practically, their roles in the struggles against an overwhelming, evil adversary."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,245,"The film comes home strong, with large-scale warfare, feats of great daring and sacrifice, and acres of dead storm-troopers."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,246,"I enjoyed the film that nicely balances being its own standalone offering and one that pays homage to and serves as an important thread in the sci-fi series. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Scary Stuff, etc. - also Available)"
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,247,"Rogue One is entertaining enough, but there is not much surprise as to how things turn out."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,248,"Hemmed in by a script that assigns truly theatrical sinisterness to pre-existing creations (i.e. Darth Vader) Ben Mendelsohn doesn't get to go 'the full Mendo', filled with pure, baleful, blackhearted menace, but hot damn - it's good to have him on board."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,249,"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is what the fans were waiting for. Ideal for the ones that aren't passionate about the saga because they will find reasons to fall in love with this universe. [Full review in Spanish]"
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,250,"Above all else, it is on a technical level that Rogue One truly excels, allowing Edwards to conjure a sizeable number of intergalactic spectacles that are as stirring as they are stylish."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,251,"Imitation, they say, is the highest form of flattery. If so, the makers of ""Rogue One"" flatter the heck out of its predecessors."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,252,Gareth Edwards tries to generate suspense by using well-worn movie cliches that display a lack of imagination and point to the flaws of telling this tale in the first place.
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,253,Rogue One is still an achievement. Every other Star Wars movie has only ever had the responsibility of telling part of a story - this manages the whole thing in one go.
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,254,"A fun outing, if also a derivative one. Donnie Yen and the droid steal the film from the leads..."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,255,"There's a comfort in being in the Star Wars Universe and you immediately feel a renewed affection for it upon re-entry. But a Star Wars film shouldn't rely on its Star Wars-yness."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,256,Rogue One does not extend the Star Wars story but there are times when it deepens it.
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,257,"The story clicks nicely into place with the events of Star Wars but that narrative is really just a blank sky in which the film's other elements can sparkle like stars."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,258,"Rogue One might not necessarily be a film that was needed but once the credits roll, you realise how much you desperately wanted it regardless."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,259,"Nothing is exultant, dramatic, epic, heroic, complex or just entertaining to me. The film is overwhelmingly empty, and lacks minimal grace and rhythm. [Full review in Spanish]"
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,260,"Rogue One is one of the best films of our favorite space saga and will undoubtedly delight the fans, even on the verge of a nostalgic and involuntary tear of emotion. [Full review in Spanish]"
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,261,"Rogue One is like its heroes. It is flawed in some ways, but it's still well worth the wait."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,262,"It suffers, like many blockbusters, from too much spectacle and not enough truth, but its greatest sin is that it feels dull, insipid and underwhelming despite a plethora of loud action scenes and dazzling visual effects."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,263,"enhances as well as annotates the Star Wars mythos, making the story we thought we knew in A NEW HOPE richer and more urgent."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,264,"In previous Star Wars movies, one side wore black hats and the other wore white...Here that's not the case. For some, this is a selling point. For me, it's close to a deal-breaker."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,265,"There's nothing to sink our teeth into, especially when we already know how it ends. There's no suspense."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,266,"Rogue One is at its best when it's at war ."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,267,"Admittedly, this can be viewed as simply another rehash of old stories and themes, but hash is rarely this tasty."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,268,A Star Wars story for the ages.
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,269,The movie the prequels should have been. Perfectly captures the spirit of the original trilogy and delivers a genuinely thrilling Star Wars film.
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,270,"Rogue One is Star Wars for hard core fans who felt left behind by the prequels, but it's got little to offer casual viewers beyond competent, uninspired thrills."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,271,"Of space dust, Joni Mitchell and the Force: a visually splendid, dramatically stirring journey spanning both yesteryear and tomorrow."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,272,"The Force is not only well and truly with us again, it seems as if it's never been gone."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,273,"An almighty triumph, the best-constructed and most fun Star Wars flick since The Empire Strikes Back. The force is truly strong with this one."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,274,"It was always one of 2016's most anticipated films and it doesn't let down the legions who have been waiting for it."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,275,Gareth Edwards has crafted the most satisfying Star Wars film since The Empire Strikes Back.
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,276,"The movie didn't rekindle the thrill of seeing, say, The Empire Strikes Back, but Rogue One will loom pretty large in the Star Wars galaxy - if only because there's so little competition."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,277,"While the principal characters are new, Edwards ensures there are enough significant nods to the Star Wars universe to enchant fans."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,278,A movie experience that is supremely captivating.
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,279,"Jones' portrayal is quite different from what we have come to expect from the Oscar nominee, and she proves she can handle the role of an action heroine with surprising ferocity."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,280,"""...has the urgency and battlefield heroism that great war movies are made of. It's incredible stuff all around."""
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,281,"""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"" is a fine stand-alone film and one that will have you anticipating ""Episode VIII,"" which is just a short 367 days away!"
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,282,"ROGUE ONE begins as an inspired concept, only to conclude with a soulless stare."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,283,"Coming from someone who is not really a Star Wars freak, I have to say I was impressed. This could be the best one yet."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,284,"There is always the danger with a film of this high profile to expect or want it to over-deliver. Sadly - though understandably - Rogue One just doesn't do that."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,285,Rogue One accomplishes what fans have wanted to see for a few decades now: making Darth Vader scary again.
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,286,"It's the trio of Tudyk, Wen and especially Yen who steal the show, each bringing to life characters that will likely go down as three of the best ever to grace a story set in the Star Wars universe."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,287,This is a gorgeous and immersive film.
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,288,"Though not meant to be an episode in the great intergalactic narrative of the series of trilogies, Edwards' Rogue One is an enthralling companion piece that fully embodies the Star Wars spirit and delivers the rousing pleasures."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,289,"Technically brilliant, Rogue One delivers the spectacle and the aerial combat that are such signatures of the Star Wars ethos, with some eye pleasing vistas of a hectic part of the stunningly beautiful universe"
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,290,"New diverse actors from around our world breathe new life into prequel that just entertainingly barely satisfactorily, repeats the tried and true themes and expensive action."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,291,"This spin-off/prequel has the same primitive, lived-in, emotional, loopy, let's-put-on-a-show spirit that made us fall in love with the original trilogy."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,292,"Of the three sidekicks, Yen's rueful but deadly martial artist leaves the best action impression."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,293,Rogue One somehow delivers on almost all of its weighty pre-release promises whilst at the same time besting The Force Awakens for sheer spectacle.
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,294,"A hugely enjoyable film, and an impressive sign of things to come. This is the perfect film for a Star Wars fan."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,295,"It's an experiment that mostly works, but there are moments when it's clear that the task of finding new areas of ""Star Wars"" to play with is a bit too much for director Gareth Edwards to handle."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,296,"We already knew this was going to be a thrilling epic, but I had no idea of the emotional punch it would pack."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,297,"I enjoyed this scrappy little movie, the second consecutive one to feature a female heroine."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,298,"Rogue One left me feeling giddy with joy at seeing the Star Wars franchise expanded with such a genuine sense of affection and understanding for what made us fall in love with a galaxy far, far away."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,299,"It offers more details of interoffice politics among the squabbling factions of both the Empire and the Rebel Alliance than probably anyone but a mid-level manager cares for. Yet you generally feel you're in good hands."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,300,"Star Wars movies have been dazzling, infuriating, heartbreaking, silly, witty, convoluted, gripping and overblown. But until Rogue One: A Star Wars story, I don't think ""dull"" was the most appropriate adjective."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,301,"[Rogue One has] well-placed humor, inside jokes, aliens, droids and creepy CGI renderings of two key Star Wars characters, all set against the backdrops of mind-bending production designs and hypnotic visual effects."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,302,"It's a downer. It's morally tangled. The characters are as depressed as the scenario, and Michael Giacchino's music can't make it better."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,303,"Disney refuses to waver from what makes 'Star Wars' matter - the battle between good and evil. Where can we send the 'thank you' notes?"
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,304,"If you're not a fan, Rogue One may not be the revelation that The Force Awakens turned out to be. But it won't have you wishing for your own personal Death Star either."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,305,"...while it's great to see Danish actor Mads Mikkelsen placed into Star Wars lore as a catalyst for the Rebel Alliance the British Jones lacks the fire Daisy Ridley brought to Chapter VII."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,306,"Lucasfilm has outdone themselves. They've delivered a thrilling installment that embodies the best of Star Wars. Rogue One surpasses every expectation."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,307,The most thrilling Star Wars experience yet.
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,308,"What results is a poignant, powerful paean to the Star Wars Universe, set in a world where the best thing you can hope for is hope itself. It's a perfect and complete standalone, but it changes everything."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,309,"If The Force Awakens was an exercise in giving Star Wars fans exactly what they want, Rogue One does its best to show them what else there is in the galaxy."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,310,"Credit to Jones, then, for imbuing the character with a steely melancholy. Moreover, her chemistry with bad-boy Andor visibly sizzles, so that you feel genuine investment in their story."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,311,"The new characters are nicely fleshed out, particularly Jones's Jyn, whose initial cynicism gradually morphs into a steely resolve, its seed planted by the memory of her father, but watered by the idealism of the Rebellion."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,312,A classic adventure story and worthy spin off of one of the most popular sagas of contemporary cinema. [Full review in Spanish]
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,313,"At its best, Rogue One is scrappy and epic in equal measure, aware of the potential to be glorified fan fiction and using exactly what it needs from the Star Wars mythology to create a vibrant, stand-alone adventure."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,314,"""Rogue One"" is definitive proof: ""Star Wars"" is back, baby."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,315,"When you realize where it's all been heading -- ending on a moment that's as transcendent as anything in 40 years of the franchise -- you'll be so, so happy."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,316,"Rogue One is one of the best Star Wars flicks to date -- as well as the grittiest, darkest, and most grounded."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,317,"Rogue One features stirring action scenes, vivid characterisation and one or two truly eye-popping explosions. Nonetheless, what it lacks is any real originality."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,318,"Doesn't break the mold in terms of franchise formula, and it's an enjoyable installment in the ""Star Wars"" canon. However, it's not much more than that."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,319,"'Because it's awesome' is enough reason for Rogue One, and it is awesome. The final space battle is the best space battle of any Star Wars movie."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,320,"Much more than a mere sideshow in the Star Wars saga, these rebels build on a brilliant legacy."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,321,"Star Wars has been filled with political commentary since the first in 1977, and this film is no different. [...] I enjoyed this more than The Force Awakens."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,322,"As the kickoff of a new phase of ""Star Wars"" on the big screen, ""Rogue One"" is a smashing success, showing there is a lot more to this galaxy than lightsabers and Skywalkers."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,323,"A perfectly satisfying summer fun film. Untidy and a little clich at first, but eventually ends up standing out because of its humor and its subversive energy. [Full review in Spanish]"
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,324,"""Rogue One"" is pure, unbridled ""Star Wars."""
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,325,"For all that feels uninspired and unnecessary in Rogue One, it's no disaster."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,326,"Gareth Edwards' venture into a galaxy far, far away is the Star Wars film we never knew we needed. It's a triumphantly thrilling, serious-minded war movie that is incalculably stronger for the fact that it's NOT the first chapter in a new franchise."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,327,Rogue One is a bright light in the Star Wars canon.
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,328,"Edwards has created the rare Star Wars property that can be appreciated as a film. And it is about as violent and downbeat as Star Wars gets on the big screen-more downbeat than The Empire Strikes Back, in fact."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,329,"Let's face it: Rogue One is the best Star Wars movie in a long, long time. [Full review in Spanish]"
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,330,"Towering like a stick-man over the rest of the cast, K-2SO provides most of the laughs in this portentous voyage into that same old galaxy far, far away."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,331,"Rogue One, directed by Gareth Edwards with a sharp script by Tony Gilroy and Chris Weitz, is a bracing and dizzying marvel, propulsively pitched and even, I dare say, moving."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,332,"In the end, this hardening of the franchise seems likely to alienate both the fans and the uninitiated."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,333,"A more than worthy adventure but lacks the brilliance of the original trilogy. It makes us have a good time, but not a memorable one. [Full review in Spanish]"
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,334,"In between all the crash bang and wallop, there are also some truly odious villains, with Vader as sinister as he's ever been and Australia's Ben Mendelsohn clearly relishing his role as the human-cyborg's psychotic chief enforcer."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,335,"The movie works even if you only have a passing knowledge of the Star Wars universe or haven't seen the original in years. But there are several enjoyable callbacks and some eye-popping surprises for die-hard fans."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,336,The Force is strong with this film -- a perfect fit as a prequel to A New Hope.
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,337,"""Rogue One"" represents an unobjectionable exercise in franchise extension. It's fine. It'll do. For now."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,338,"Even though the film is much grungier and more realistic than all the previous chapters, this corner of the ""Star Wars"" universe still is a thrilling place to visit."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,339,"The movie has a completely different, more sophisticated feel than most recent special effects-driven entries, including last year's so-so ""The Force Awakens."""
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,340,"It's too grimy and relentlessly bleak to be any fun, and lacks the substance and drama to be taken seriously."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,341,It tries so hard to be an epic masterpiece - with self-important speeches and an insanely outsize orchestral score - that it ends up a laughable parody of itself.
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,342,"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is the best Star Wars movie since 1980's The Empire Strikes Back."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,343,"A solid film with its own vision and tone, yet undeniably still a part of that wonderful galaxy far, far away."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,344,"If the franchise can continually pull off blockbusters with the same level of creative energy and the proper amount of reverence as Rogue One does, there's every reason to expect greatness for years to come."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,345,"If only the two-hour plus runtime made time to dig into its heroes like the original trilogy or The Force Awakens did, Rogue One could have been as sensational and satisfying."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,346,"For this lived-in universe, Rogue One features some distinctly CGI distractions: revisiting classic characters and resuscitating them 2016-style. It's crude and unnecessary in a film that's otherwise fairly sturdy, if unremarkable."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,347,"This is exactly what Edwards always said he was going to make - a STAR WARS war film. People die, and tears will be shed. Anyone who thought it would be watered-down should think again."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,348,"""Rogue One"" stands on its own, an entry that is at once part of the ""Star Wars"" franchise (obviously) but also separate - a tougher, grittier film."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,349,Almost pedantic in its inoffensiveness.
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,350,"All the pieces are there ... like Lego figures in a box. The problem is that the filmmakers haven't really bothered to think of anything very interesting to do with them."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,351,"The action sequences, both on the ground and in space, are rousingly staged. But the losses incurred in those sequences are sobering. The stakes in the ""Star Wars"" rebellion are high indeed."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,352,"When the universe ""expands"" in this way, it actually makes it seem so much smaller."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,353,It is a brave attempt at making a new kind of Star Wars movie but seems all too eager to express its fealty to the source material without thinking up any ideas of its own.
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,354,"Intriguing and richly diverse characters, a suspenseful plot, an amusing sidekick, and a very satisfying answer to one of the most persistent questions from ""New Hope."""
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,355,"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story succeeds far more than it doesn't, and has some rich characters and terrific performances (specifically Tudyk and Yen) to go along with the beautiful visuals and intense action."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,356,"Rogue One isn't so much a movie as a feature-length promotional film for itself; it's a movie that is still waiting to be made."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,357,Rogue One is a bold and stirring adventure film that will have both fans and casual observers spellbound.
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,358,"It's constant blowing stuff up. Jyn Erso is STAR WARS ""Joan of Arc"" without a zealot's fervor or dynamic leadership presence. She is the only female fighter and all the nomad soldiers blindly follow her. What happened to Mendelsohn's face?"
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,359,Rogue One: A Star Wars Story does exactly what it is supposed to do by incrementally expanding the Star Wars universe that we already know.
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,360,"Hard-core fans who thought Episode VII was a dumbed-down rehash will bask in an action-packed film that refuses to spoon-feed information. Mind you, that's the same reason why the casual fan will be disengaged."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,361,"This is a whole new stable of characters operating on the fringes of the world we know by heart. When you think about it, that's pretty exciting. And it opens up a world of cinematic possibilities moving forward."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,362,"Aside from [K-2SO's] killer lines, wonderfully voiced by the indispensable Alan Tudyk, most big satisfactions in this big, big movie come from references to Star Wars adventures you've loved before."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,363,"It stands alone as the best Star Wars entry since 1980's The Empire Strikes Back. Yes, it's that good."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,364,"Just once I'd like to see a Star Wars film and be wowed by seeing something completely new and fresh. I didn't hate it, however it commits the crime of being underwhelming and unoriginal."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,365,"Rogue One is groundbreaking for the Star Wars franchise, a rousing side story that blows the doors wide open for future installments of the series. That it stands on its own as a slam-bam action thrill ride is a bonus."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,366,"As pure retcon-meets-thought experiment, Rogue One scratches an itch that has been tickling since that initial screening in '77."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,367,"Rogue One is worthy of standing alongside the original trilogy. Not only in terms of quality, but in creativity, imagination, and inspiration."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,368,"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story answers the question of whether that galaxy far, far away is big enough to sustain multiple offshoots with an emphatic yes."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,369,"Contained yet expansive, nostalgic yet new, Rogue One introduces striking heroes and villains and fills its two hours and 13 minutes with a narrative that fits snugly into canon."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,370,Rogue One is a more-than-worthy prequel. Which is a first in the Star Wars universe.
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,371,"Rogue One is better than [the prequels] by a long shot, but after the high bar set by last year's Episode VII - The Force Awakens, simply being better than the prequels isn't good enough anymore."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,372,"The chaps are heroic. The villains are dastardly. All that's missing is Burton and ""Broadsword calling Danny Boy""."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,373,"The Force Awakens may have reanimated the once-dormant franchise, but it's Rogue One that will give Star Wars fans a new hope."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,374,"K-2S0 contributes sorely needed humor, but nowhere near enough."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,375,The good news is that Star Wars fans will never want again... but the movies themselves may have gotten a little less special as a result.
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,376,"Despite its darker tone, Rogue One feels cosily at home in the Star Wars universe, and is crowded with the kind of imagination-tickling details the franchise thrives on."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,377,"Rogue One shouldn't work - from everything from the reshoots to just the fact Star Wars is breaking from centering its story around the Skywalkers - but, yet, it does work. Mostly."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,378,Technically deft but emotionally cold.
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,379,"Even an underwhelming Star Wars is a pretty decent Star Wars, but Rogue One misses a real chance to turn the familiar into something remarkable."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,380,"Star wars, indeed: The thrilling ""Rogue One"" brings a gritty combat-movie aesthetic to George Lucas's beloved space opera, but not at the expense of a thoughtful, emotional story about the foot soldiers who make sacrifices in the name of a movement."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,381,"A little bit ""Guardians of the Galaxy,"" a little bit ""Dirty Dozen"" in its mass wartime slaughter, and a pretty good time once it gets going."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,382,A more-than-worthy addition to the galaxy far far away.
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,383,"...doesn't move the bar on what it means to be a Star Wars movie in any significant way."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,384,"A much bolder addition to the franchise that makes risky deviations from the winning formula. That those bold decisions pay off is impressive, most ...well, you know the rest."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,385,"For all its vivid visual imagination, the film left me almost totally cold. And I say that as a man who has cried actual tears at more than one Star Wars movie."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,386,"Rogue One is a movie crammed with fan service, but when fan service is done this well, there's little to complain about and much to adore."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,387,"Very good, and often great... A true cockle-tickler for fans hoping to stoke the excitement of their inner nine-year-olds."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,388,"A movie that pushes boundaries and takes the kinds of risks this series needs to take in order to evolve to a point where it can tell completely new Star Wars stories featuring characters we've never seen before."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,389,"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story upends Lucas' familiar saga by zeroing in on the compelling lives outside the orbit of the Skywalkers. There's one word that accurately conveys what this movie does to the Star Wars universe: Rebellion."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,390,"A swiftly paced, rough-and-ready entertainment that, in anticipating the canonical events of ""A New Hope,"" manages the tricky feat of seeming at once casually diverting and hugely consequential."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,391,"The ultimate Star Wars fan film, it's short on whimsy but when it gets going there's enough risk-taking and spectacle to bode well for future standalones."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,392,"In a series of by-the-bible films, this is the iconoclastic one. And that's its charm."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,393,Rogue One manages to succeed as both super-nerdy fan service and the first entry since the 1977 original that will satisfy people who have never seen a Star Wars film.
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,394,"This story isn't going to be like any Star Wars movie you've ever seen."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,395,"For the original generation of ""Star Wars"" fans who weren't sure what to make of episodes one, two, and three, ""Rogue One"" is the prequel they've always wanted."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,396,"It's a flawed movie, but a good one, sometimes more interesting as a concept than a story. But, oh, what a concept!"
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,397,Rogue One is the best Star Wars film since The Empire Strikes Back.
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,398,"Rogue One might trade heavily in nostalgia but it's bold enough to take risks, and will leave you stirred, fired up and raring for more."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,399,"Rogue One is a big, crazy video game movie -- but even big, crazy video game movies are allowed to say something."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,400,"This movie is about the journey, not the destination. And the journey is about as exciting as a long drive down the Florida Turnpike."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,401,"Rogue One is a return to form and the Star Wars movie fans have been waiting for since the '80s."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,402,"Despite a galaxy of potential and a number of killer moments, Gareth Edwards' Star Wars spinoff feels painfully forced."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,403,"I'm recommending it, if only as a three-star action movie. But I think it's important to consider how the original Star Wars movies transcended their pulpy influences and how Rogue One gets mired in them."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,404,"If nothing else, Gareth Edwards' combative, hard-working installment answers why the Death Star was so easy to destroy in the first place."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,405,Its variations on a theme are muscular and adroit. This is another really entertaining fantasy with fan-fiction energy and attack.
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,406,A punchy standalone action tale about a spunky Rebel Alliance resistance group.
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,407,"This instalment isn't about looking backwards. In essence, it's a war movie and director Gareth Edwards keeps the momentum going with a string of stunning set pieces."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,408,"Still too reliant on nostalgic fan-service, but a clear step in the right direction for these newfangled 'Star Wars' movies."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,409,The Force should have been stronger with this one.
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,410,The Star Wars franchise has built up a massive amount of cachet over the last several decades; Rogue One is going to need every bit of it.
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,411,"Loaded with more battle action than any of its seven predecessors, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story plays like a set-up for the events in the 1977 original and, for the most part, does so quite entertainingly."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,412,"Yes, it's part of a series that is now eight movies strong, but it also works alone as a movie about war, oppression, a dangerous heist, a daring rebellion and a spark of hope that ignites the final stages of a revolution."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,413,Rogue One is less the fetish object that The Force Awakens is because it at least has the ambitions to create its own character dynamics and plot routes rather than coast on existing ones.
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,414,Will give die-hard Star Wars fans multiple orgasms...runneth over with Star Wars spectacle.
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,415,"A thrilling, but flawed drama that considers the cost of fighting for one's beliefs."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,416,"This is more like it...the 'Star Wars' movie J.J. Abrams SHOULD have made."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,417,"This ""Star Wars"" spinoff doesn't spin very far off from the franchise, but it's a serviceable stopgap between chapters."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,418,"Seems to want nothing more than for the audience to pat itself on the back because they know what Yavin 4 is: It's a fun game to play at Comic-Con, but it doesn't make for much of a movie."
RogueOne,RogueOne_rm,419,"Boasts thin characters played by great actors scampering about far too many planets with names that sound like obscure venereal diseases. It's a ""Star Wars"" knockoff that happens to look a lot like a ""Star Wars"" movie."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,0,"For a long, glorious stretch, Shazam! plays like the anti-Nolan antidote it is."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,1,"It's a bummer when the bad guy shows up and Shazam becomes like every other superhero movie - worse, really, because the storyboarding is so poor that it's hard to tell what's going on. In the climax, Sandberg misses nearly every one of his marks."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,2,"Director David F. Sandberg remains a horror guy at heart (Lights Out, Annabelle: Creation), and the ping-ponging between yuks and yikes leads to a pretty nasty case of aesthetic whiplash."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,3,"""Shazam!"" is the funniest, sweetest and most innocent movie in the DC Extended Universe - a sign that it is at last ready to compete with Marvel."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,4,"""Shazam!"" is hardly a solution. But at its best, it's just deft and clever enough to not feel like part of the problem."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,5,"What ""Shazam!"" lacks most obviously is gravitas. And grimness. Also bleakness, darkness and relentless self-seriousness. In other words, it's terrific fun."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,6,An entertaining fantasy adventure that never loses its spirit of fun even when it otherwise falters.
Shazam,Shazam_rm,7,A fun superhero movie and not just for the reasons that usually make superhero movies fun
Shazam,Shazam_rm,8,"What ""Shazam!"" does really, really well is pummel us with more aggressive versions of well-worn blockbuster tropes."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,9,"...a seriously appealing premise that's employed to decidedly erratic effect..."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,10,One of the most thoroughly entertaining and emotionally grounded films the genre has given us in recent memory.
Shazam,Shazam_rm,11,"[It's] endlessly entertaining, a ton of heart while making plenty of meta-commentary on the superhero genre."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,12,"...[T]his film melds the unpretentious, dreamy joys of old-time comic books with the sly, rambunctious humor of Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoon featurettes..."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,13,Get rid of the brash and broody DC and deliver movies like Shazam! more often. This is what superhero movies should be like - very good and unashamedly fun.
Shazam,Shazam_rm,14,"David F. Sandberg has made Shazam! intentionally small, leaning into the goofiness of its concept and leaving some time for small-scale human drama."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,15,"It's good, but it's not great, so everybody needs to just calm down...calm down."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,16,"What's impressive about the warmth and wonder that dominates Shazam is that the warmth ekes out on all levels even as the film recognises the ever-present darkness of the world."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,17,"I can applaud Shazam! for trying something new in its attempt to hone the Saturday-morning-cartoon-feel it's clearly aiming for"
Shazam,Shazam_rm,18,"It's Power Rangers under a different name, it's a Nickelodeon type cartoon re-envisioned for the big screen."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,19,The mood of Shazam! is blissfully nostalgic. The acting from the well-rounded and perfectly chosen cast is terrific.
Shazam,Shazam_rm,20,"This is what Shazam! does best: puts you in an underprivileged, bullied teen's head, and lets you feel how mind-blowingly exciting it would be to suddenly have powers with which to smack every bully upside the head."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,21,"More focused on pleasing kids than most superhero films, the film is graced with breezy performances, a slick sense of humour and the theme that even superheroes can't do it alone."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,22,"I'd give Shazam! a pass on ""you can choose your own family"", even though it hammers at it like a Fast and Furious movie. That said, it's an unassuming breath of fresh air."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,23,"If you're looking to be entertained for a couple of hours, then you've come to the right place. But if you want a smarter movie, then look elsewhere."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,24,A breath of fresh air for DC. [Full Review in Spanish]
Shazam,Shazam_rm,25,"Levi at least is having fun, his puppyish excitement occasionally transcending the rote material. But he's a bright spark in a film that never ignites."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,26,"The second Captain Marvel movie to be released this spring, DC's valiant effort doesn't soar as high as its Marvel counterpart, though there's still a hefty amount to enjoy in this thematically loose-limbed undertaking."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,27,"Charming, high-spirited and embraces its youthful, goofy side."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,28,"""Amusing, but the same old shit""."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,29,"Shazam is easily the second best DCEU movie and fun for the whole family (but parents be warned, it might be a bit graphic for some little ones)."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,30,Shazam! is an unequivocally silly movie that happens to be ridiculously fun too.
Shazam,Shazam_rm,31,"So good at depicting the ins and outs of this family group... that it's an active disappointment whenever the film feels compelled to leave it."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,32,"'Shazam!' is the DC Universe's most solid movie [along] with 'Wonder Woman' and 'Man of Steel'. [Full review in Spanish]"
Shazam,Shazam_rm,33,"The action finale of Shazam! takes place at a carnival. It's clever, and packs a surprising emotional payoff. The same can be said of this whole big goofy irresistible flick. It isn't too soon to call this one of the best superhero movies ever."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,34,"The transformation is complete. The grim 'n' gritty darkness of the early DCEU movies seems like a distant memory."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,35,"Compared to the rest of the DCEU, Shazam feels Marvel-esque, almost like a kiddie-friendly, less-overtly-meta version of Deadpool."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,36,"It's like 'Big,' only with a cape and without Tom Hanks."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,37,"Shazam! is definitely a film for 15-year-olds, but might I suggest it's also for grown-ups who haven't seen their teen years in a very, very long time?"
Shazam,Shazam_rm,38,"The most fun movie -- in terms of simply being entertaining -- from that comic book line since perhaps the 1978 Christopher Reeve version of ""Superman."" (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Profanity, etc. - also Available)"
Shazam,Shazam_rm,39,"This a fun, funny, exciting, action-packed, thrilling, big-hearted, sincerely-felt family adventure movie that rates with the best of the superhero genre."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,40,"Shazam! can't decide whether it wants to be a superhero movie or a parody of one."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,41,"Despite elements that are both corny and confusing, SHAZAM! has real heart with likable characters experiencing real teenage problems--even in the body of a superhero."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,42,"It was one of the best payoffs in the final act of a superhero movie that I've ever seen."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,43,Shazam! is the most enjoyable superhero movie that DC Comics has made. [Full review in Spanish]
Shazam,Shazam_rm,44,"The way the movie switches quickly back and forth between adult and child themes, comedy and horror, is a bit disconcerting, but it worked for me. I am not sure how well it would go over with young children."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,45,"The screenwriters, Henry Gayden and Darren Lemke, prove unable to elevate the material beyond its 1970s Saturday-morning-television feel."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,46,"An unabashed triumph for the DC Universe, delivering charming characters, laugh-out-loud humour and pleasingly goofy comic-book action in crowd-pleasing quantities."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,47,"It's a welcome reprieve from the dreariness superhero films can bring, and what it lacks in consistency it more than makes up for in the final, emotional wallops."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,48,"Happily, Sandberg's commitment to the weirder aspects of this universe pays off, especially when he plays it with a straight face."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,49,"If you left the cinema feeling meh, don't worry. There are a few of us for whom Shazam! did not spark or take off, which is ironic for a lightning-powered superhero."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,50,Shazam! is a superhero movie that would have been better without superheroics.
Shazam,Shazam_rm,51,"[An] engagingly cheeky and robust popcorn pleaser. In any event, 'Shazam!' is a heroic hoot for the ages."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,52,"It checks all the superhero boxes while also having a spirit that is undeniably its own. Action-packed, self-aware and legitimately funny, Shazam! is a high-flying delight."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,53,"Mostly satisfying, often juvenile, Shazam! is a Christmas-in-Easter superhero origin story.... Ultimately, one wishes there had been more bounce and less grit."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,54,"Drawing from a wealth of material with more supporting Marvels and hangers-on than can be accommodated in one film, Shazam! picks and mixes with confidence."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,55,"The major problem with ""Shazam!"" is its constant back-and-forth shifting between irreverent comedy and darker moments, provided by Mark Strong's evil Dr. Thaddeus Sivana, who doesn't even crack a smile."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,56,"It breaks the formula enough that I felt like I was seeing something I haven't seen before, while also being warmly familiar."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,57,"When's the last time a DC movie ended and you left the theater actually excited to see the story continue? That happens here."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,58,"Fresh and fabulous, this blast of a superhero adventure ticks all the boxes. It is funny, cool and the narrative flies on the wings of a good script and excellent direction."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,59,"Zachary Levi effortlessly steals the spotlight in a crowded landscape of hero films with an instantly iconic performance, and I personally want to see more of what follows."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,60,"I can't even deny it. Shazam is a freakin' blast."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,61,"The comedic chemistry between stars Zachary Levi, Asher Angel and Jack Dylan Grazer is hard to fault."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,62,"The overall result is a welcome new entry into the superhero genre that chills, thrills, subverts and massively entertains."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,63,"Had Shazam! been given the green light to forgo world-building and genre considerations to concentrate harder on its strengths, it would have been something very special instead of just very refreshing."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,64,Presents more of the same with a funny premise. [Full review in Spanish]
Shazam,Shazam_rm,65,"While never going full Deadpool in dissecting the tropes of comic book lore, it pokes fun at the genre while simultaneously making sure DC finally gets the memo: superhero movies can just be an unashamedly good time."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,66,"Shazam! is not a great movie, but it's just good enough to wash some off the grungy smell of the earlier DCEU entries and freshen things up a bit."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,67,"Sandberg juggles tone to great effect, weaving together an effervescent sense of humor, satisfyingly emotional moments and exciting, character-driven action."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,68,"Resisting the power of a consequence-free existence to embrace what's important in life is a noble goal, and tapping into that is the film's true magic... a welcome addition to the New DCEU; if only they'd found that Magic 8-Ball sooner."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,69,"In a vacuum, Shazam is an exceptionally average film. Among superhero movies, and especially those outside the Marvel brand, there's a lot to like about Shazam."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,70,"Shazam! has big action, big laughs, and a big heart underneath."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,71,Shazam! wears a big heart on its sleeve.
Shazam,Shazam_rm,72,"It riffs mightily off Tom Hanks' Big - Big in spandex if you will, and has a giddy joy in its superpowered hero akin to that of the earlier Superman films."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,73,"The stakes in Shazam! aren't quite world-endingly high but are resonant for their universality, and the film bounces well between kid-focused humor and suitably scary action sequences."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,74,"Even the standard crash-bang action scenes -- although not especially inspired -- are enlivened by the film's vital freedom: it's not trying to be cool."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,75,"The Easter holidays approach and first of the family blockbusters to show face is this cheeky, refreshingly enjoyable if overlong take on superhero movies."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,76,"A silly, irreverent, ebullient, easily forgotten escapade."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,77,"Shazam! was a delightful, sentimental superhero flick that is exactly what the doctor ordered for DC."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,78,"Shazam! is not a perfect film--there's something moribund about its early going, and while the gags are reliably fun, they're seldom all that original. What works is the picture's lightness."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,79,"Okay... it's cute. And if you're 9 years old, you'll think it's pretty good. There's not a lot here to appreciate if you're an adult, and you'll watch it while fondly remembering Spider-Man: Homecoming which abso-freaking-lutely nailed the comedy and pathos"
Shazam,Shazam_rm,80,"Thanks to a script filled with razor-sharp quips, a fully committed performance from Levi, and an unapologetic embrace its own goofiness, Shazam is an absolute blast."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,81,"DC -- owner of the Batman, Superman and Justice League franchises, of course -- has found itself a new film superhero. And he's a winner."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,82,"The title may end in an exclamation point, but I was left with a different punctuation mark hanging over my head."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,83,"...Think of Shazam! as D.C. comics' DUPLO - a simplified and safe take on what could be seen as the Marvel Comic Universe's LEGO, a well-designed, scalable and interlocked structure of franchise success."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,84,A more personal and down to Earth tale with very relevant overtones about bullies and the damage they can inflict...
Shazam,Shazam_rm,85,"A mixed bag, but its a good time at the theatre."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,86,"A lighthearted film, a bit superficial, but innocent that flows with enough grace for an enjoyment without too many demands. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Shazam,Shazam_rm,87,"Zach Levi embodies the childlike wonder of this experience so well, you can't help but go along for the wish fulfillment ride."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,88,Shazam! has a smart mouth and a heart of pure gold.
Shazam,Shazam_rm,89,"The film takes care to plant the seeds of its world building, making the promise of a return all the more enjoyable."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,90,"It's an effervescent genre entry that's not afraid to indulge in the irreverent silliness that drew so many of us to comic books in the first place."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,91,Shazam! succeeds with a pure heart. [Full Review in Spanish]
Shazam,Shazam_rm,92,"Bursting with humour, both silly and at times risqué, David F. Sandberg's film is a pure delight."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,93,"Zachary Levi is born to play the role as Billy Batson. Shazam is a heartfelt, emotional, surprising and funny, a superhero film for everyone."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,94,"It's grounded, funny, and seems to take place in the real world, with something that was notably missing from the early DCEU pictures: joy."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,95,"David F. Sandberg manages to compose a beautiful, funny and self-conscious tribute to Richard Donner. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Shazam,Shazam_rm,96,"Nice blend of action and comedy but Levi and Angel were supposed to be playing the same character. When ""Billy Batson"" gets superpowers he loses brain cells."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,97,"Shazam! is the best film of the DCEU thus far, an action-packed adventure full of humor and heart."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,98,"It has just enough charm and gentle humour to be enjoyable, the way a hot milk drink eases the transition to sleep."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,99,"Superhero comics were originally aimed at kids. It's refreshing to me to see a superhero movie that remembers that, leans heavily into the adolescent wish fulfillment and isn't obnoxiously self-serious."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,100,A movie that is just as much about family - not necessarily the one you are born with - as it is about super powers and vanquishing bad guys...
Shazam,Shazam_rm,101,"After lazy reliance on phoney gravitas and blundering with its first serious stab at levity with Aquaman, DC has found a comic torch-bearer of pure heart to illuminate the path of righteousness ahead."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,102,The filmmakers were going for (and mostly achieve) the 1980s Amblin Entertainment feel of a movie out to have an unpretentious good time - a welcome throwback to days before comic books movies became gargantuan and grim.
Shazam,Shazam_rm,103,"There's a sense of Stranger Things camaraderie among Billy and his foster siblings, who are actually fun to spend time with, and the film's message of found family is a sweet one."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,104,"A terrifically fun comedy, a serviceable superhero movie."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,105,"Shazam! works better as a wacky buddy comedy than as a superhero movie, and the genre is all the better for it."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,106,"Not only is Shazam! the best DC Extended Universe film...it's also the best DC Comics movie since Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,107,"There is a wondrously cheesy sincerity to SHAZAM! that makes its weak spots irrelevant. It is, in many ways, as pure of heart as its champion, and just as giddy about discovering that magic is real."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,108,"The delight of this movie rests in the equal parts of sincerity and fun the actors bring to a much needed reboot of the D.C. brand, besieged by characters and story lines whose self-seriousness is at odds with their discount cosplay aesthetic."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,109,"Sweet, fun, heartfelt experience. Not the dark depths of evil we are used to in superhero films lately. But why does the pretty teenage girl need to be so useless in a fight and why did a family film have to have a strip club?"
Shazam,Shazam_rm,110,Whatever magic this film holds just passed me by.
Shazam,Shazam_rm,111,"For lack of a better word, this movie simply rules, and DC would be smart to hand Sandberg the keys to the future of their kingdom. He's earned it after this one."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,112,"Shazam may get his power from a wizard, but it is Zachary Levi's performance that really is the magic behind this fun and heartwarming film."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,113,"Shazam isn't as flashy as its DC counterparts, but it brings a lot of heart and laughter to the screen as a superhero movie suitable for the whole family."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,114,"Shazam is an uproarious showcase for the charming Levi, with an entertaining and heartwarming final act."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,115,"Shazam! launches a superhero franchise that has a quality that shouldn't be dismissed: It doesn't seem to matter much and, in the high-stakes world of other superheroes, that's a definite virtue."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,116,"Shazam! is a coming-of-age tale that reminds us that we have to grow up when the situation calls for it. At the same time, it's OK to remain a child at heart and to have a brighter outlook on the world."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,117,"There are plenty of sight jokes, but these never descend into farce and the dialogue is quick and witty."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,118,"The climactic battle drags, going on for far too long. ""Shazam!"" could have been a major revelation if it was edited more tightly and took itself less seriously."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,119,"A work that constantly strives to defend its own distinctive personality, but can not completely avoid the dangers. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Shazam,Shazam_rm,120,"While it plays to some of the similar beats of a superhero film, it hits so many notes on its comedy, performances and storytelling. If this is the track record DC is going with...I'm all about it."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,121,
Shazam,Shazam_rm,122,"The main thing you get from this movie is a lot of fun and a lot of heart. You can give it credit in moments where the special effects aren't the best."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,123,"It's like having a party, watching this film. Overall, it's really good, even though there are problems with the movie...I cared about them less the second time."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,124,"An atypical blockbuster, exemplary and carefree in which the great heart of his dramatic vision works at the same level as his look of unpretentious amusement. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Shazam,Shazam_rm,125,"Shazam! is a fun time at the movies, and it tells an interesting story in a very enjoyable manner."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,126,"Clearly, not all heroes wear capes...it runs a tad too long...but the film delivers laughs and emotions. A refreshingly goofy superhero movie."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,127,Surprisingly funny. Very good cast. I still think the suit is padded.
Shazam,Shazam_rm,128,Something like a family film from the dying years of the first Bush administration.
Shazam,Shazam_rm,129,"Shazman is the new superhero kid on the block as Zachary Levi's energetic, yet heartfelt performance nails his DC character for years to come!"
Shazam,Shazam_rm,130,"The crucial distinction for Shazam! is that it doesn't seriously expand the idea beyond Superman and Batman being public knowledge; the movie is perfectly content being its own fun little thing."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,131,"All-in-all, by investing in comedy, DC has pushed all the right buttons as far as this franchise is concerned. Let's hope the good run continues and Shazam! brightens up the rather dark and dreary DC Universe."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,132,Shazam! just refused to take any risks and put all its eggs in the family and comedy basket. The performances by all the leads are the best part of the film.
Shazam,Shazam_rm,133,"This is a passable movie, lifted by the humour and by Grazer's performance. It does become stereotypical towards the end, but that, like the ability to leap tall buildings in a single bound, is part of the DNA of superhero films."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,134,"Take away the comedic moments from the trailer and I was left a depressingly bland movie. Shazam! was kind of a douchebag and Levi's serious face made him look like he was taking a giant dump."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,135,"Shazam! seems acutely aware of the self-serious, killjoy reputations of some of its DC universe brethren. It both celebrates the nerds who've stuck it out this long and (gently) dunks on the franchise's wonkier moments."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,136,"The truth is, the DC Justice League version of Captain Marvel is a lot of fun, mostly family friendly (except for a monster biting off a guy's head), and just a tad too long to earn an extra 50 cents in yours truly's money-tinged ratings system."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,137,"You can't help but root for a protagonist who, once he realises he has superpowers, uses them to make strangers pay for selfies with him and to pose at the top of the steps where Stallone's Rocky Balboa used to do his workouts."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,138,"Although it doesn't have great special effects, the action sequences are good and entertaining. [Full review in Spanish]"
Shazam,Shazam_rm,139,"The screenplay never falls prey to melodrama, and the usual genre tropes are acknowledged, then promptly downplayed. The stakes are relatively lower than what we're used to, and yet crucial enough within this film."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,140,"Shazam! is surprisingly good - as immensely enjoyable, in fact, as Wonder Woman was."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,141,"Under David F. Sandberg's direction... the film moves along with great energy. [Full review in Spanish]"
Shazam,Shazam_rm,142,"At times there are elements of The Goonies about it... not world changing, but it was fun."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,143,A fine representation of the appeal of superheroes and comic books.
Shazam,Shazam_rm,144,This is probably the funniest DC movie so far.
Shazam,Shazam_rm,145,"Goofy, often quite funny, sometimes touching, and occasionally a bit darker or nastier than I expected from a superhero movie that seems to want to skew younger than most."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,146,"Shazam! makes the most of its child-in-a-man's-body theme, and only wears out its welcome in a messy finale."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,147,"In context and considering the movie monstrosities that have preceded it, Shazam! is irrepressibly fresh and wholesome, and ultimately suggests a new and exciting future for the stars of the DC Extended Universe. Up, up and away!"
Shazam,Shazam_rm,148,"Shazam! gets a little greedy towards the end, and it could probably stand to lose at least 20 minutes from its noisy finale. But hey, it gets the job done. It might just kick-start a new franchise. It's a bit of a hoot. I didn't see that coming."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,149,"It's a fantasy film laced with comedy where the kids are the big attraction and fun to watch"
Shazam,Shazam_rm,150,"Shazam! could well be a remedy for a ""super"" market saturated with dark, brooding action heroes."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,151,"Shazam!'s candy-floss sweetness rarely fails to hit the spot."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,152,The hero we need at the moment.
Shazam,Shazam_rm,153,"Sadly, all this takes far too long to get going - the film could lose 15 minutes at both ends - but it's fun when it does, and Levi milks every drop of goofy comedy out of the superhero guise."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,154,"While screenwriter Henry Gayden may be adapting a character from Fawcett Comics, through much of the movie, he's cleverly updating Penny Marshall's Big."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,155,"At its heart, Shazam is a movie about making your own family, bridging the gap differences seem to make, and having a good laugh while you do."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,156,"It's a bird! It's a plane! No, it's just a fun, frothy superhero film, and there's little wrong with that."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,157,"The greatest element of Shazam! is that it doesn't fall into the trap of earnestness. It is not ashamed to embrace the more outré elements of the comic book universe."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,158,"I certainly wouldn't mind seeing [Shazam] teamed up with other DC characters in future films, but as a standalone movie, it had my inner 14-year-old dreaming of the ability to speed up time, or at least hit a magic fast forward button in the IMAX theater."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,159,"Billy Batson has the power to become a grown up superhero in Shazam!. By doing so, he gives us the power to become children again. A truly heartfelt and sincere origin story. [Full review in Spanish]"
Shazam,Shazam_rm,160,"Teenage Billy and superhero'd Billy often barely register as the same character, a flaw in the central conceit needed to make Shazam! really work."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,161,"The fun, breezy film captures the imaginative joy of curling up with a comic book as a 12-year-old and envisioning the boundless superhero dreams that burst to cinematic life."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,162,"Earns its punctuation through unrelenting, gee-whiz cheerfulness. Fueled by nerd energy and sold by a goofy cast, this superhero spin-off carves its own path through the usual comic-book material."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,163,The new superhero in town bursts on screen in a blaze of adolescent energy and excitement. At last we have a DC character filled with mirth rather than mourning.
Shazam,Shazam_rm,164,"Think Batman's sidekick, a few years younger, in a more outrageous costume with primo superpowers, Shazam! (2019)"
Shazam,Shazam_rm,165,"Fun and funny, Levi's charismatic captain is a marvel."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,166,Shazam! is the magic word that turns the DC Extended Universe into a super-charged good time.
Shazam,Shazam_rm,167,"Shazam! wants to be slick & smartassy except when it suddenly chooses to be warm and sincere-like a TV commercial for some medication or life insurance. You can't have it both ways but this film repeatedly tries to do so. This movie is a muddle"
Shazam,Shazam_rm,168,Adventures in superhero-ing.
Shazam,Shazam_rm,169,"As the troubled DC Extended Universe finally finds its footing, after a quick sprint along no man's land and a dip in the ocean, it finds itself in an odd situation - emerging, as it were, from an abusive past, determined to reignite its passion for life."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,170,",,,a fun entry in the superhero genre that dares touch on the underlying theme of all these films: they're wish fulfillment for nerdy kids who feel put-upon in real life."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,171,"That special kind of magic that has eluded most of the DCEU cinematic efforts finally makes an appearance on screen, and it's an absolute blast. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Shazam,Shazam_rm,172,Shazam! is the kind of carefree superhero film that reinvigorates the fantasy of actually being  a superhero.
Shazam,Shazam_rm,173,"Leaning real hard into the jokes about horny teenage boys and meta-skewerings of superhero films, Shazam! can't help but comment on its genre ad nauseam, though, unlike Deadpool, it never risks arguing against its own existence."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,174,Shazam! Ekes Out a Good Time
Shazam,Shazam_rm,175,A joyous celebration of friendship and family in all its oddball guises.
Shazam,Shazam_rm,176,Samberg imparted a distinct style to this film and freed it from having to share or expand a cinematic universe all for the best. [Full Review in Spanish]
Shazam,Shazam_rm,177,"It's fine as a superhero movie but better as a warmhearted story about makeshift families."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,178,"Put simply, Shazam! is nothing more than non-stop fun, which at its best both sends up and stares down every stale and stodgy superhero flick you've ever had to sit through."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,179,"[Shazam!] revels in its comedy and post-modern self-reference, undercutting serious moments with humor like we've seen Marvel do for so many years now."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,180,"Thank you, Shazam!, for breaking through our superhero fatigue when we needed it the most."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,181,"Good-natured fun that hews to a rather old-fashioned comic-book sensibility...very much a live-action cartoon, in spirit and style."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,182,"So beyond working as an advertisement for D.C.'s other movies, Shazam! also offers a stiflingly claustrophobic cinematic landscape, which has no point of reference outside of D.C.'s own intellectual properties."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,183,"The DC Universe finally learns how to laugh combining big chuckles with heartfelt moments DC rarely placed in the Man of Steel or Batman. Zachary Levi is the latest likable superhero, stepping into the box-office-gold of Wonder Woman and Aquaman."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,184,"Shazam! is a heartwarming story that talks about finding the joy in being a hero, and in finding the family that understands you."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,185,"Functioning both as a standard, predictable, but completely serviceable Hollywood blockbuster and something a bit more comedically irreverent, Shazam! is the type of film that's good enough and smart enough..."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,186,I loved the spirit and the heart of this film.
Shazam,Shazam_rm,187,"Jack Dylan Grazer's Freddy flat steals the movie with his charm and sincerity."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,188,"The suits and cheesy hairpieces can go, but Angel, costar of Disney Channel's Andi Mack, will be more than welcome to return as the kid half of this heroic tandem."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,189,"Shazam! arrives with an honest and simple story that isn't afraid to let its hero have fun with their powers. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Shazam,Shazam_rm,190,"Put it this way: in terms of superhero movies, it's more fun than most, because the comedy is self-satirising. It's fairly rough around the edges."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,191,"No offense to the interconnected, multi-layered storytelling of the Marvel Cinematic Universe or the DC Cinematic Universe, but sometimes it's fun to watch a movie about a doofus in a cape."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,192,The film is so attuned to the fundamental appeal that superheroes have for children that it feels like the first film in an age designed specifically with them in mind...
Shazam,Shazam_rm,193,"Best of all, Shazam! feels young, a world apart from that stone-cold cosmos in which self-serious villains descend upon humanity with their dumb jeweled gloves."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,194,"While the humor is definitely broad, ""Shazam!"" still offers some terrific laughs. Most of the time, it's bright and fun and good-natured."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,195,"The film's enthusiasm may be a little overwhelming at times, but it is contagious."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,196,"Shazam! is irreverent in a sweet way, not a cynical way like Deadpool. There's more reason to fear a ""suitcase wedgie"" (don't ask) than the threatened planetary destruction (yawn)."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,197,"Being retro is not always a good thing, but in Shazam!, it amounts to a breath of fresh, lightning-singed air."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,198,"This movie is basically ""Big"" with a superhero. Need I say anything more? That premise already has you in the popcorn line, right?"
Shazam,Shazam_rm,199,"Emphatically earns its exclamation mark, but very little rewatch value with this one."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,200,"Pure magic! Funny, charming and by far the most enjoyable film to date from the DC universe. [Full review in Spanish]"
Shazam,Shazam_rm,201,"Again, not the most original idea, but here it is presented with the unbridled joy of two teens who have just found the keys to their parent's liquor cabinet."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,202,"[Shazam!] has the irreverence of Deadpool, but much less cheek. [Full review in Spanish]"
Shazam,Shazam_rm,203,"""Shazam!"" is a superhero story that's rooted in a tale of family. It's able to fly because it's so grounded."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,204,"""Shazam!"" operates as a thrilling fantasy and a comedy about the learning curve of growing up. It's also a stirring tale of the heroic potential that lies inside each of us, if only we're put to the test."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,205,Shazam! will entertain and thrill. [Full review in Spanish]
Shazam,Shazam_rm,206,"With just one word, 'Shazam!' becomes a winner for the DC Extended Universe."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,207,"After Patty Jenkins' Wonder Woman, Shazam! is even better-placed to let the fun bubble back."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,208,"It all adds up to a surprising winning formula -- an unexpected bit of fun that is one of the better DC creations. ""Shazam!"" is so effortless, it makes you wonder why it took the DC universe so long to get it right."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,209,"Shazam!, a movie explicitly built around our childhood fascination with superheroes. One wonders how the franchise producers manage to make sense of it all."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,210,"Zachary Levi is easily the best part of ""Shazam!""... Unfortunately for him, the film more or less turns out to be a one-man-show that sags considerably when he is off the screen."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,211,Swings further into the goofy abyss than necessary.
Shazam,Shazam_rm,212,"Sometimes these types of movies are only as good as their villains, but ""Shazam!"" rises above because the comedy, courage and family elements are super-strong."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,213,"Shazam! is a great superhero film, because it pokes at the silliness of these stories while still embracing the core of why they matter."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,214,"There's magic within ""Shazam!,"" but it's also pure magic as well. When it comes to the amount of smiling you'll do, few things in 2019 so far can compare."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,215,"""Shazam!"" has a long list of strengths, starting with a cheeky, bright sense of humor that leads to many laugh-out-loud moments."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,216,Even the most jaded superhero fan (hands up) will find something to like here.
Shazam,Shazam_rm,217,"For the most part, 'Shazam!' is a joyous and upbeat superhero movie that values the importance of family."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,218,Shazam! ended up being exactly what I needed when I needed it.
Shazam,Shazam_rm,219,"A playful, witty, clever, teen-centric jaunt that soars with a simple, uncluttered story, free of the past and full of both humor and heart."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,220,"The movie's one joke gets old quickly, and what's left is a slow, underwhelming superhero story, along with some equally slow family drama."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,221,"An impressive first cinematic outing for one of DC's most loved superheroes."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,222,"Wildly entertaining, downright delightful, and, yes, adorable."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,223,"The best, most complete entry yet in the new DC Comic Universe."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,224,"[A]mid the unattributed riffing, the pinballing among YA-style quaintness, perv jokes, and graphic jolts, you start to realize: ""Shazam!"" is pretty entertaining."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,225,"It really does not have to be as packed with comic-book references or be as long or have as many characters as it does, but this go at an origin story makes up for its bloat with strong comedy performances."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,226,"Once Billy says that magic word and his supersized alter ego appears, the movie goes to its happy place and comfortably embraces its own identity as a light, jocular, modest entertainment."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,227,"Genuinely sweet and funny in a way that feels unforced. And whereas most superhero movies are inherently Calvinist, Shazam's refreshingly simple, straightforward message is ""don't be an asshole."""
Shazam,Shazam_rm,228,"""Shazam!"" is goofy but good."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,229,"Shazam! continues DC's newfound grove as the weirdo cousin of the superhero movie multiverse."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,230,"In a genre that often tries way too hard to be taken seriously, Shazam! is a pile of good-natured fun."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,231,"Best of all is that DC Comics doesn't run from its primary-colour roots this time."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,232,"We're just as invested in Billy's search for his long-lost mom as we are in his ability to jump off a skyscraper unscathed. Now that's super!"
Shazam,Shazam_rm,233,"Truth be told, though, one wishes the movie had a little more heft to it. It's fine, even welcome, to see a superhero exult in his abilities, and on that level, ""Shazam!"" is generally fun."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,234,The refreshing tone and a wonderfully winning performance by Zachary Levi combine for a delightful experience ...
Shazam,Shazam_rm,235,"Shazam! is a throwback in all the right ways: a superhero tale for a simpler blockbuster era, one that is well worthy of viewers' nostalgia."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,236,"While a little leisurely paced, I still can't say there was any time watching Shazam! where I felt DC's latest superhero was failing to deliver the goods."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,237,"In a comic book movie-saturated world, Shazam! comes along and makes it feel new again."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,238,"This is a campy, over-the-top, action comedy with heart, and not a comic book-inspired deep dive into the conflicted minds of flawed human beings."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,239,"To paraphrase Jack Lipnik, the studio head in ""Barton Fink"": It has heart. And we need more of that in motion pictures."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,240,"Solid, entertaining superhero fare aimed at younger viewers."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,241,"In Shazam!, the positives outweigh the negatives. The film's fresh aspects are strong enough to keep the stale ones at bay."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,242,"Kid-friendly without straining to be too down with them, Shazam! is a film that finally injects the F-word into DC's dark and angsty universe: fun."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,243,A manic two-hour exclamation mark.
Shazam,Shazam_rm,244,"But turning these tropes into jokes isn't the same thing as deconstructing them, and underneath the laughs, ""Shazam!"" might just be the purest distillation of the comic-book ethos to come to big screen."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,245,"A fun flick but frightfully schizophrenic, seemingly aimed at children but too long and too crude to pass muster with smaller kids."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,246,"Despite shortcomings, Shazam! is a fun time at the movies for the most part and easily one of the better outings in the DC stable."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,247,"DC's answer to Marvel's Ant-Man: a family-friendly, comical comic-book adventure that never crosses the line into camp."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,248,Shazam! is the humanist kind of blockbuster we see all too rarely nowadays
Shazam,Shazam_rm,249,Zach Levi and Jack Dylan Grazer steal the show in this superhero film that turns the usual weaknesses of origin stories into a fun time with a good message about family
Shazam,Shazam_rm,250,"Although it's technically about saving the world (again), Shazam! plays out at eye level, grounded by the belief that who people love and where they feel they belong is stakes enough."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,251,"While the story of ""Shazam!"" may be unwieldy at times, Levi and his kid costars make this new (to us) superhero just so gosh-darn appealing, it's hard to resist making room in our hearts for one more."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,252,"The latest action fantasy in the DC Comics stable might not be very deep, but it is a whole lot of fun."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,253,Zachary Levi shines as the electrifying energetic star of Shazam!
Shazam,Shazam_rm,254,"Superhero comedy is charming, goofy, with fantasy violence."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,255,"Like the '80s Spielberg films to which it's paying clear homage, Shazam! manages to balance its irreverent goofball antics with a surprisingly emotional nucleus."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,256,"The film brims with self-awareness and chutzpah, building a bridge between fearless kids and encouraging adults who know when to let the heroes take over."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,257,"Shazam! is a breath of fresh air in the cluttered comic genre. Mixed with heaping spoonfuls of heart, humor, and adventure; Shazam! reminds us how much fun being a superhero can be"
Shazam,Shazam_rm,258,"While Shazam! is goofier (and darker) than it may look, you'll wish its superhero came with a little more spark."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,259,Thirty minutes of fun in a two hour and twelve minute movie.
Shazam,Shazam_rm,260,"Nothing matters in this literal adolescent-male power fantasy, a cheesy mishmash of nonsense and low stakes. Anyone who needs at least a bit of meat in their superhero tales will be disappointed."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,261,"...it's the most fun to watch of all the DC films!"
Shazam,Shazam_rm,262,"With an enthusiastic energy that's genuinely infectious and a screenplay that deftly flows with equal lashings of humour and heart, the resulting film is pure cinematic bliss from start to finish."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,263,Shazam! redefines the DC superhero film... through light humor and touching family moments.

Shazam,Shazam_rm,265,"Power by a firecracker Zachary Levi and a junior-Deadpool irreverence, Shazam is an irresistible blast of comic-book kick-ass that slaps a smile on your face that just won't quit."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,266,This is the superhero movie that explains why kids love superhero movies.
Shazam,Shazam_rm,267,"Endearing performances... can't overcome the pedantic world-building and generic C.G.I. gyrations."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,268,"Unlike so many superhero films, where the final third reverts to CG spectacle, Shazam! really takes flight, with inspired jokes, emotion and surprising cameos that deliver a real blast of joy. It's bound to be a festive family staple for years to come."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,269,The film packs so much heart and fun with a superhero that truly feels like no other.
Shazam,Shazam_rm,270,"Big for today's superhero crazed world; hilarious, packed with heart and carelessly breezy."

Shazam,Shazam_rm,272,"While Shazam! has its share of action and heavy moments, the film ultimately works best as an irreverent comedy."

Shazam,Shazam_rm,274,"It's balancing out with Man of Steel for my favorite DC movie at this moment...for the most part, I was in from start to finish."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,275,"Lighthearted and campy, Shazam is a happily self-aware throwback."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,276,"The trailer did not do it justice. This is great. Just, so so great. This movie blew me away."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,277,"SHAZAM! is a bright cheery sugar rush of a movie. It made me leave the theatre thinking, ""Is it too late to give this whole DCEU thing another shot?"""
Shazam,Shazam_rm,278,"Given the relative obscurity of the hero, expectations for his solo picture were essentially non-existent, so the film easily ends up rocketing past whatever hopes there are and landing in a place of pure delight."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,279,This is one incredible introduction to a hero. One that had me screaming in the theater!
Shazam,Shazam_rm,280,"Family friendly but not childish, skewing younger than Wonder Woman but with just as much charm, DC has knocked it out of the park with Shazam!."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,281,Shazam! is a fun superhero movie that the whole family can enjoy
Shazam,Shazam_rm,282,A superhero movie that does its best to combat the silliness of its premise through the use of humour and fine action set pieces.
Shazam,Shazam_rm,283,"There hasn't been a superhero movie quite like Shazam! since Sam Raimi's Spider-Man, revitalising the optimism and childlike wonder of superhero movies for a modern age."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,284,"While loaded with good intentions, it's an overlong, underwritten film with casting issues, giving Shazam a rocky introduction to the big screen world of costumed heroism."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,285,"The CGI... I'm just going to squint and blur my eyes because I'm trying to like this and I'm having fun."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,286,Shazam! is exactly what a super hero movie is supposed to be -- fun and complete entertaining escapism.
Shazam,Shazam_rm,287,Shazam! focuses so much effort to being funny that it sacrifices the inspirational part of being a hero. The result is an entertaining comedy and middling superhero movie.
Shazam,Shazam_rm,288,"Impressively, [director David] Sandberg captures the wonder, magic, and inherent danger of these astonishing tales, creating a frequently hilarious, earnest, and adventurous ride."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,289,"It invests in how the young (or young at heart) characters interact with all the ridiculous superhero mechanics thrown at them. They do it with heavy dollops of humour, excitement and wonder."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,290,"Like a kid-friendly ""Deadpool,"" the film combines action, broad comedy, and emotion into a pleasing brew."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,291,"For a movie that clearly operates on a heightened plane, it actually feels relatively realistic."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,292,"Shazam! is bright and colorful, both visually and emotionally, and is a nimble, effervescent take on the superhero origin story."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,293,"I'll be darned that DC made a Big-esque origin film out of him and, honestly, it works!"
Shazam,Shazam_rm,294,"Shazam! wears its heart unabashedly on the sleeve of its hero's over-the-top superhero suit and embraces some of the sillier aspects of the genre."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,295,The most complete beginning-to-end film in the DCEU so far.
Shazam,Shazam_rm,296,This heartfelt origin story is more than the sum of its immense charm and Spielbergian attention to detail.
Shazam,Shazam_rm,297,"I was shocked and kind of delighted that a movie like this could be so scary... in a throwback to the '80s and '90s kids movies."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,298,Proof Warner Bros. might have cracked the master code to making films equal to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. So much fun and immensely entertaining.
Shazam,Shazam_rm,299,"By letting this movie stay true to the nature of the character, Shazam! is free to have a unique voice of its own."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,300,Shazam! is as blandly presentational as a market research PowerPoint.
Shazam,Shazam_rm,301,"With heart and imagination to spare, Shazam is the real deal and you shouldn't miss it."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,302,"A (mostly) family-friendly movie that is not only a delight, but probably the slickest DC movie in years."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,303,"A magnificently heartfelt, entertaining and hilarious look at a what happens when a good kid takes on the body of a man and the powers of a god. Solidifies DC's new direction!"
Shazam,Shazam_rm,304,"Zany is the bullseye of Shazam! and, boy, is that all kinds of satisfaction."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,305,It gets a bit repetitive.
Shazam,Shazam_rm,306,"Shazam excels best when the daffy and vintage performance by Levi soaks up the screen, this despite Sandberg's need to utilize and adopt every superhero cliché in the book."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,307,"Plenty to like here, especially Zachary Levi's unabashedly-exuberant performance in a role he's born to play. I have my quibbles but still excited for what Shazam will do next in the inevitable sequels."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,308,"A raucous, charming kid adventure that is a delight to behold from start to finish, Shazam! feels like a throwback both to '80s comedies and to the superhero movies of the early 2000s."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,309,Horror director David F. Sandberg is the perfect choice to bring this character to fruition because of these nightmarish themes.
Shazam,Shazam_rm,310,"Even when Shazam! falls for the Superhero movie tropes, it does so with a smattering of comedy that elevates it above the status quo."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,311,But the origin story of Billy Batson is earnest and actually builds in time for the story and the characters to breathe.
Shazam,Shazam_rm,312,"""Shazam!"" is the magic word as far as DCU establishment is concerned, as David Sandberg proves WB's superhero slate can be hilarious, heartfelt *and* pack an electrified blast of action all at the same time."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,313,"It's a gloriously successful hybrid of BIG, ANTWONE FISHER and SPIDER-MAN, with the best part of GREEN LANTERN thrown in for good measure, proving that AQUAMAN and WONDER WOMAN were no flukes."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,314,"Ridiculously entertaining and non-stop fun from beginning to end, Shazam! is the reason why you go to the movies."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,315,The innocent nature of it all is hugely enjoyable.
Shazam,Shazam_rm,316,It has fun moments but the tone was all over the place and jarring.
Shazam,Shazam_rm,317,"In the vein of Gremlins, Shazam is an edgy family movie that pushes the edge of the envelope in a very fun and exciting way! Mark Strong's villain is MVP."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,318,"Loaded with amusing gag after amusing gag and a perfectly measured lighthearted approach, with just enough emotional resonance. It's an energizing kick that will ensure superhero fatigue does not become a real thing"
Shazam,Shazam_rm,319,"Shazam! is a game-charger for the DCEU and comic book movies in general. It is an amazing family movie with incredible fight scenes, and great humor."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,320,"""Shazam"" exudes a boyish spirit appropriate for a superhero origin story about a teenager who gets invested with powers far beyond his adolescent imagination. This latest DC adventure is, however, a mixed bag that doesn't quite work."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,321,"Shazam solidifies the DCEU even more, giving us a superhero film with strong comedic elements while still having depth and heart."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,322,"In the pantheon of the genre, SHAZAM! is pure superhero entertainment."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,323,"'Shazam!' is an irresistibly fun mix of 'Big,' 'The Goonies,' and a superhero movie"
Shazam,Shazam_rm,324,"Shazam is a delight! Vibrant, tons of heart and a great fun-loving vibe. The family element is a big charmer and so is watching Zachary Levi explore his new powers. Also, if you didn't already know this thanks to IT, Jack Dylan Grazer is sensational."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,325,"If you've been a lifelong Shazam fan, you'll be pleased to see that [the filmmakers] found a way to make this often-neglected DC character fun and even cool at the same time."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,326,"Captures the original comics' combination of breezy heroism and nutty plotting, transferred from the 1940s to the modern era with great skill."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,327,The perfect origin story. It has fun teaching us the mythology of Shazam powers and teaching Billy to become a true hero. I love all these characters and hope to see them again in many more Shazam! films. Franchise Fred approves.
Shazam,Shazam_rm,328,"It's absolutely amazing how much fun DC can be when it's not taking itself so damned seriously."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,329,"The trick of Shazam! is that the movie kind of realizes it's about a dopey character, so they lean heavily into the dopiness."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,330,"It's the kind of stuff that is going to make my six-year-old nephew laugh, but it's also going to make my parents laugh. My face hurt from laughing. Hey, all-age chuckles!"
Shazam,Shazam_rm,331,"David F. Sandberg, a genre director known for conjuring scares in Lights Out and Annabelle: Creation, delivers an outright joyful fantasy that doesn't waste a moment on feeling self-conscious."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,332,"Buoyant and unpretentious, Shazam! aims low and mostly succeeds, a kid-friendly caper powered with enough energy to keep its target audience engaged with a fun central conceit that plays like a cross between Big and Superman."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,333,"This superhero has great power, and great responsibility, but ""Shazam!"" wears it lightly and humorously."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,334,"The ponderousness and ambivalence that hang over many of the ""grown-up"" entries in the genre are absent here; Shazam! is a big open sky inviting you to come on up and test out those flight powers you just acquired."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,335,"Lightning doesn't even strike once in Shazam!"
Shazam,Shazam_rm,336,"A welcome antidote to the usual brooding DC fare, an upbeat superhero movie that feels young at heart."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,337,"After the great success of Aquaman, many have been hoping that DC's next film, Shazam! will live up to the brilliance of the film prior and I'm beyond glad to say it does."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,338,"Ultimately, Shazam! is probably a little too mature for actual children and too childish for adults, but it's serviceable enough to warrant a sequel that explores the good, clear ideas introduced in this one."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,339,"While the superhero action and comedy may be Shazam's big selling points, what makes it truly great is the touching story of a foster family weaved around everything else."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,340,"""Shazam!"" is just a lightning bolt of unexpected joy that is certainly worth your time and money."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,341,"It's almost as if superhero stories were at heart about wish fulfillment. It's almost as if they're allowed to be fun."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,342,"Whenever Levi is on screen, wowed by his new grown-up physique (his muscles seem to have muscles) and shocked by his newly discovered powers, the movie soars."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,343,"The very fun and funny Shazam! is DC's most joyful and sweet movie since the era of Christopher Reeve's Superman."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,344,"It's official: the Zack Snyder era of the DCEU is over once and for all."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,345,"What is often the most businesslike part of a superhero origin story-establishing the hero's powers-ends up becoming the most entertaining part of Shazam!, carried along by Levi's fidgety, boyish charm."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,346,"Shazam is a pure of heart, instant classic that adds a terrific new success story to the growing arsenal of the DCEU."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,347,"Shazam! is a wildly fun superhero adventure, with plenty of humor and heart, but struggles at times to strike a good balance between levity and drama."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,348,"Supes and Bats will never die, but in Shazam, a character who's been around for seven decades and is only now breaking through into the mainstream, youngsters have a new family-friendly hero to call their own."
Shazam,Shazam_rm,349,In a word: magic.
Solo,Solo_rm,0,"Obviously fans are happy to keep revisiting the bellowing Wookiee and the warp-speed dashes through the wide beyond, and satisfying as it is, Solo gives them what they want: more of the same."
Solo,Solo_rm,1,"Luckily, just as tempers were starting to flare, Solo: A Star Wars Story has arrived to save the day."
Solo,Solo_rm,2,The tropes and twists of shamelessly recycled clichés are presented throughout with an absurd earnestness.
Solo,Solo_rm,3,"Of all the Star Wars-themed movies, this one is the closest to a Saturday afternoon serial/western. Don't expect more than that."
Solo,Solo_rm,4,"Young Han can only watch helplessly as the gravity of the Star Wars children's crusade overwhelms him and the wondrous fun run gives way to a joyless slog that actually undermines the heroism of A New Hope even as it seeks to foreshadow it."
Solo,Solo_rm,5,"Whenever ""Star Wars"" tries to develop one of the franchise's key characters, it whiffs. ""Solo"" is no exception, a disappointment on par with ""The Last Jedi"" and the prequels."
Solo,Solo_rm,6,"Solo: A Star Wars Story has a few missed opportunities and might not change anyone's life, but it is an enjoyable film with fun performances."
Solo,Solo_rm,7,Survives on nostalgia and good faith rather than telling a story that brings new ingredients to the recipe
Solo,Solo_rm,8,"Fans hoping to experience some of the most important parts of Han's legacy will have plenty to look forward to here, including the genesis of his lifelong friendship with Chewbacca, and an infamous game of sabacc against Lando."
Solo,Solo_rm,9,"Solo is an entertaining ride that would make for a fun trilogy of its own. Although not everyone is used to their full potential and none of the action sequences are show-stopping, there are some nice teases for what comes in the future."
Solo,Solo_rm,10,Solo: A Star Wars Story is a spiritless movie for a brave character. [Full review in Spanish]
Solo,Solo_rm,11,"Overall I had a blast with this movie. It's a proper space adventure, you can even call it a space heist flick. I enjoyed the high-octane action scenes, specifically the chase scene in Falcon."
Solo,Solo_rm,12,"It was the pulpy space adventure I had been looking for and hadn't gotten for the last 2 films but L3 is the worst"
Solo,Solo_rm,13,"Space western that does a decent job of forming a backstory we definitely didn't need. [Full review in Spanish]."
Solo,Solo_rm,14,"The character deaths in Solo: A Star Wars Story will leave you feeling angry, as they are unearned and disproportionately affect women."
Solo,Solo_rm,15,"A promising and entertaining franchise-builder, but never quite gets to the heart of what makes Han Solo so legendary."
Solo,Solo_rm,16,"The story is a bit slight and there are certain narrative mysteries that might have been better left unsolved, but all in all, it's a fun space opera/heist movie with a charming cast and some strong set pieces."
Solo,Solo_rm,17,"Think of it like an appendix to your favorite book. It's a fun movie, but only because of its subject matter and characters. It can't stand on its own."
Solo,Solo_rm,18,An old school blockbuster film that is far more entertaining than it has any right to be.
Solo,Solo_rm,19,"It might not pack nearly as big a punch as Disney's other offerings, especially fresh off the emotional devastation that was Infinity War, but Solo: A Star Wars Story is still a journey worth taking."
Solo,Solo_rm,20,"I think in this case, it's kinda like a magician revealing their tricks. It's still interesting to know and see, but it does lose some of the edge too."
Solo,Solo_rm,21,"In short, it's clearly a movie made by committee with many hands on deck."
Solo,Solo_rm,22,"Has some flaws, but it's mostly a harmless and fun film, and certainly deserved more attention and box office gross than it ended up getting."
Solo,Solo_rm,23,A fine addition to the Star Wars franchise that grows in my estimation every time I watch it.
Solo,Solo_rm,24,"For all the sci-fi trappings, however, the movie has the feel of a Western, which is apt enough given Han's image as the coolest gunslinger in the galaxy."
Solo,Solo_rm,25,"The truth is, Solo is far from a risky venture-there's nothing surprising in it, just some good old-fashioned action-driven fun."
Solo,Solo_rm,26,"I honestly hope the magic isn't completely gone from the Star Wars universe, because it certainly appears to be with this latest standalone film."
Solo,Solo_rm,27,You might wanna buckle up baby because Solo brings the fun and adventure - if maybe not hitting the zany heights of previous entries.
Solo,Solo_rm,28,Solo is so hellbent on shoehorning in ironic callbacks to previous films that the teasing presence of such breadcrumbs is more frustrating than nourishing.
Solo,Solo_rm,29,"The film, as a whole, is unabashed fan-service ... Still, I had a great time watching it and its own way of conveying the fun and feel of the original films."
Solo,Solo_rm,30,"It's fun and satisfying but it never reaches the heights it's aiming for."
Solo,Solo_rm,31,"It's far better than I expected, and I truly believe that the backlash will fade over time so people can really appreciate how Ron Howard pulled it all together."
Solo,Solo_rm,32,Solo: A Star Wars Story represents the highs and lows of the series.
Solo,Solo_rm,33,"Solo does its damndest to generate tension, mostly by cramming every second of screen time with action and plot advancement."
Solo,Solo_rm,34,"Solo feels more like a placeholder for a better movie yet to come...a pretty good, completely fine movie. Not bad, not great, just watchable."
Solo,Solo_rm,35,"Once the movie (and the actors) settled in, I forget all of my predispositions and worries and went along for what amounted to an extremely fun ride."
Solo,Solo_rm,36,"It makes a welcome change from the overthought, gurning pretensions of the Abrams-Edwards-Johnson fanboy exercises, and catches something of the spirit of the original trilogy"
Solo,Solo_rm,37,"Solo isn't terrible, it isn't great; it's fine. A serviceable, if unmemorable space western that is pretty much redundant."
Solo,Solo_rm,38,Solo plays it safe with an iconic character known for taking risks.
Solo,Solo_rm,39,"Solo never does make the case that it needs to exist but, in terms of quality of execution, it's possibly the best movie one could hope for given the brief it has to fulfil."
Solo,Solo_rm,40,"For the most part, it's almost the perfect in-betweener Star Wars movie."
Solo,Solo_rm,41,"Unlike 2016's Rogue One, a heavier story predestined to end darkly, Solo is more of a caper that whizzes and hums along with the spritely energy of its title character."
Solo,Solo_rm,42,"When the supporting cast is more appealing than your main character, it's hard to care about what they're supporting."
Solo,Solo_rm,43,"Solo may have the look and feel of a Star Wars movie along with some iconic characters, but it's missing the heart of one."
Solo,Solo_rm,44,"Solo is an uneven at times and pretty minor journey into that galaxy far, far away, but it has enough moments of simple fun that it steers clear of being an all-out disaster that many feared."
Solo,Solo_rm,45,"I exited the theater with the same sense of delight and surprise that Han Solo expresses after a successful escapade through danger: well, I'm glad that somehow worked out."
Solo,Solo_rm,46,"On the surface, Solo resembles the classic Star Wars film, but it doesn't take long to determine that Howard's entry is just a meek variation of the beloved franchise."
Solo,Solo_rm,47,"If you allow yourself to surrender to its fast-paced heists and winning performances, it's a cracking little space adventure about the dregs of the galaxy."
Solo,Solo_rm,48,"Ehrenreich tries the best he can, but just can't capture the same arrogant charm that Harrison Ford made so iconic. He winds up being just as bland and forgettable as the rest of the film."
Solo,Solo_rm,49,"There are many enjoyable moments and sequences, a handful of surprising twists and revelations and a bevy of great performances."
Solo,Solo_rm,50,"There is so much to love in SOLO: A STAR WARS STORY. From great character design to even more brilliantly executed practical effects, the pros far outweigh the cons with this production."
Solo,Solo_rm,51,"It's entirely safe. It takes few risks and prefers to deliver what's entirely expected from its viewer. We get what we came for, and barely anything more."
Solo,Solo_rm,52,"Solo doesn't just make the young Han boring; it reaches back and retrospectively makes the older Han more boring, too. That's some trick."
Solo,Solo_rm,53,"I'll throw my hands up and say that I didn't think Solo: A Star Wars Story was a good idea."
Solo,Solo_rm,54,"There's enough swashbuckling action to stay for the ride for the rest, but don't be surprised when none of it moves you afterward."
Solo,Solo_rm,55,The film is restless and hardly provides any reason to exist.
Solo,Solo_rm,56,"Solo isn't a disaster, it's just an uninspired showing that is passably entertaining."
Solo,Solo_rm,57,"Honestly, all the big draws to the film were the biggest letdowns of it for me."
Solo,Solo_rm,58,"The movie is a blast, one you should definitely see if you have not, and you probably will since most Star Wars fans are completists even when they profess to hate a given installment."
Solo,Solo_rm,59,What frustrates me is that it seems the original directors were trying to build an element of unpredictability into pre-manufactured franchises. What we have is the heartwarming Han as our connection to Star Wars grows a little dimmer.
Solo,Solo_rm,60,I left with the sentiment of feeling uninspired...how am I coming out of a Star Wars movie like that?
Solo,Solo_rm,61,"I don't know how they botched it with such a great cast."
Solo,Solo_rm,62,"None of what the movie did made up for the fact that I still just didn't come out of this movie understanding the character of Han Solo any differently."
Solo,Solo_rm,63,It was cohesive and the narrative made sense.
Solo,Solo_rm,64,"What's onscreen simply isn't magical enough. It might please die-hard fans to know how Han got the last name or how he made the Kessel Run in less than 12 parsecs...But I think even they might be disappointed."
Solo,Solo_rm,65,"It's enjoyable, but this saga used to be iconic. Now [Star Wars has] merely become an aesthetic. And that's ok."
Solo,Solo_rm,66,Alden Ehrenreich is a very snappy bit of casting.
Solo,Solo_rm,67,"So what's missing? The rogue spirit that let Han steal scenes in A New Hope so easily."
Solo,Solo_rm,68,"It's not a perfect film, but it is a pure fun summer adventure. That's what they were going for, and that's what they absolutely crush."
Solo,Solo_rm,69,"A few unexpected twists towards the end, and the work of its top-notch cast... simply aren't enough."
Solo,Solo_rm,70,"I enjoyed [Alden Ehrenreich], I thought he was charming and cute. All the things I think about when I think about the character Han Solo."
Solo,Solo_rm,71,If anything it was a bit TOO much action. I would have like to substitute that with more story.
Solo,Solo_rm,72,"A scruffy nerf herder in a ""galaxy far, far, away..."" Solo: A Star Wars Story, a movie that has no reason to exist, is a fun lovable escapade that gives us a new introduction to the most famous non-Skywalker in the galaxy."
Solo,Solo_rm,73,"This doesn't give much room for the actors to breathe. It's a miracle Ehrenreich is able to make anything at all with Han, given how much mimicry he has to do."
Solo,Solo_rm,74,"This is not one of the best Star Wars movies, but it isn't a failure either. It works as a little adventure with winks at its classic predecessors."
Solo,Solo_rm,75,"Even without Ford's sideways grin and whiskey edged roughness, Ehrenreich's got enough swagger and bravado, cool cockiness, and sex appeal to pull it off. And he's fun to watch."
Solo,Solo_rm,76,Gladly abandons its tired out mythos (for the most part) by providing a fun space adventure that both fans and moviegoers can have a great time with.
Solo,Solo_rm,77,"These characters are among the best parts of Solo, which does have good moments amid the awkward choices and ticky-boxing approach to Han's backstory."
Solo,Solo_rm,78,"How did we get an origin story where Han Solo is not only NOT the most interesting character in the movie, he's honestly maybe sixth or seventh?"
Solo,Solo_rm,79,"Howard is an excellent director and even given a beleaguered franchise movie, he delivers an epic fantasy picture that enthrals audiences from start to finish."
Solo,Solo_rm,80,"With fantastic action sequences, a stellar cast and character dynamics, and a story you can get behind, Solo is very much worth the watch."
Solo,Solo_rm,81,"Solo: A Star Wars Story is a rousing space cowboy yarn with a lot of action, fun special effects, a little romance, a few laughs and some tricky plot twists."
Solo,Solo_rm,82,"Solo revels in retro fun without groveling for fans' approval."
Solo,Solo_rm,83,"There are more interesting and new unexplored corners of the Star Wars universe, unfortunately [Han] Solo's backstory isn't one of them."
Solo,Solo_rm,84,"Despite all of the derivative banter, screen saver imagery and simplistic moralizing, Ehrenreich's combination of reckless glee and stubbornness endure with the same bravura Ford's did in the original Star Wars."
Solo,Solo_rm,85,"Solo: A Star Wars Story is made for the geeks, and I mean that as a compliment. It would pass the Comic-Con smell test with flying colors."
Solo,Solo_rm,86,"What it doesn't do, is expand the mythology in any way, and unlike the far better ""Rogue One,"" it lacks the confidence to tell a different kind of story."
Solo,Solo_rm,87,There are some pretty good surprises here and I advise everyone to go in clean!
Solo,Solo_rm,88,"Ultimately, Solo's biggest disappointment is that it is forgettable, especially among the sea of other hero movies that came out recently."
Solo,Solo_rm,89,"It has a solid grounding in the series, and a respect for the people who made and love it."
Solo,Solo_rm,90,"All in all, ""Solo"" is a welcome piece in the continuing ""Star Wars"" saga!"
Solo,Solo_rm,91,"Solo: A Star Wars Story wants to benefit from its main characters' legendary status without contributing much to it."
Solo,Solo_rm,92,"At its best, Solo captures the origins of that unique mix of characteristics, portraying the young Han Solo as a man trying to find his voice and his identity and having to fit himself into the mold of outlaw smuggler."
Solo,Solo_rm,93,"""It flatters Millennial audiences, who are largely unschooled in the literary-cinematic history of chivalry, to romanticize their own self-gratifying assumption of virtue-signaling."""
Solo,Solo_rm,94,"Solo is actually fun, a rip-roaring adventure that never forgets that it's - and for better or worse, never aspires to more than - essentially a space Western."
Solo,Solo_rm,95,A complete whiff...
Solo,Solo_rm,96,"Considering everything Han Solo has been through, the new movie isn't as bad as, say, being frozen in carbonite or that long-awaited reunion with his son. But it isn't far behind."
Solo,Solo_rm,97,"A stand alone film with great special effects, that pays homage to the Star Wars franchise while creating new and refreshing characters."
Solo,Solo_rm,98,A fan-pleasing machine writ large across a swiftly-paced yarn with good humour and a handful of boisterous action set-pieces.
Solo,Solo_rm,99,"A jovial jaunt with long-beloved figures, as opposed to a future-thinking continuation."
Solo,Solo_rm,100,"The kind of glossy, undemanding romp the franchise has been aching for."
Solo,Solo_rm,101,"It's entertaining and maybe that's enough. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Solo,Solo_rm,102,"It's a feel-good take on the saga's flyboy - and as such the film is immensely satisfying."
Solo,Solo_rm,103,More fun than it has any right to be. Ehrenreich and Glover are terrific younger versions.
Solo,Solo_rm,104,"Passable Star Wars entertainment...which adds up to it being sort of a disappointment. The messy production schedule is evident in final product, but it certainly has enough moments to make it fun at times."
Solo,Solo_rm,105,No Star Wars installment has been more lost in space than this one. [Full review in Spanish]
Solo,Solo_rm,106,"In conclusion, Solo is a playful space adventure film... whose B series charm connects it directly with the spirit of the original films. [Full review in Spanish]"
Solo,Solo_rm,107,"The two entries into the new trilogy have felt epic and heavy but also joyous and uplifting. Solo tries to grasp at both ends of this spectrum, with doomed romances alongside soaring Falcon chase sequences, but it never really reaches either."
Solo,Solo_rm,108,"It is a rollicking, action-filled space adventure full of rogues and monsters, evil-doers and femme fatales, space ships and robots."
Solo,Solo_rm,109,"The trio [of Ehrenreich, Glover, and Clarke] might've made an excellent film, had they been given better material than the exposition heavy dialogue in Solo. Would that it were so simple."
Solo,Solo_rm,110,"It's a shame that a project that on paper had the potential to be something interesting, turned out to be a movie so mediocre for a character who doesn't deserve that. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Solo,Solo_rm,111,"""Solo: A Star Wars Story"" unveils at breakneck speed: seldom slowing down for any viewer but the most ""Star Wars""-literate to comprehend much more than a simple he's-good-he's-bad-shoot-fast-and-speed-off storyline."
Solo,Solo_rm,112,The problems extend from characterization to plot.
Solo,Solo_rm,113,"Maybe some Star Wars stories don't actually need to be told."
Solo,Solo_rm,114,"It's all good. And that's its problem. This was the film for Star Wars to go completely rogue. It didn't. Yes, it might have been bad. But at least it wouldn't have been so boringly, satisfyingly good."
Solo,Solo_rm,115,Solo is essentially a 135-minute version of the River Phoenix sequence from Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade - only it looks like complete garbage and is no fun at all.
Solo,Solo_rm,116,This is the most authentic Star Wars movie since The Force Awakens.
Solo,Solo_rm,117,"How Han Solo meets Chewbacca is one of the highlights of this thoroughly enjoyable, action packed adventure in which friendships are forged, hearts are broken; and plans change."
Solo,Solo_rm,118,This spin-off works despite some of its shortcomings and successfully entertains. [Full Review in Spanish]
Solo,Solo_rm,119,"Filmmaker Ron Howard delivers a narrative that doesn't, at the outset, hold a lot of promise..."
Solo,Solo_rm,120,"A movie meant to cash in on one of Star Wars' most iconic characters. But going in with those kinds of expectations leaves you with a movie that is pretty fun most of the time."
Solo,Solo_rm,121,"The fan service is strong with this one, dropping easter eggs, deep cuts, and obscure references that touch upon everything from the original movies to the prequels and even some of the Marvel and Dark Horse comic book series."
Solo,Solo_rm,122,"There's no ""force"", so you don't have to keep track of who's got the force and who's strong with the force. There's a good villain and a surprisingly heartfelt romance. But the heart of the film is the relationship between one man and his wookie."
Solo,Solo_rm,123,"If you want to see a perfect example of a once-loved and brilliant movie franchise being milked bone-dry, then the prequel spinoff ""Solo"" is the movie for you."
Solo,Solo_rm,124,"You can go ahead and put me firmly in the ""loved it"" camp. It wasn't a perfect movie, but it was enjoyable from beginning to end, and I had a lot of fun."
Solo,Solo_rm,125,"Solo may not be the best Star Wars movie (it's definitely not the worst), but it's an important one that should provoke conversations."
Solo,Solo_rm,126,"The movie is at its best when it's just about the one-upping maneuvers of interstellar con men (and women, and various nonhumans)."
Solo,Solo_rm,127,"Howard raises his game here, speeding us through unusual landscapes and top-notch set pieces."
Solo,Solo_rm,128,"Howard keeps everything moving at a whip, as if he wants to finish the film under twelve parsecs. But speed paradoxically doesn't make for excitement. Too much breathlessness and we simply suffocate."
Solo,Solo_rm,129,"Watching Ehrenreich is one of the film's greatest pleasures. His performance balances the weaknesses in a script filled with starts and stops and a movie whose pace stutters rather than flows."
Solo,Solo_rm,130,"Focussed, fun and faithful to the lore, Solo is a worthy and entertaining expansion of the Star Wars universe."
Solo,Solo_rm,131,"Great popcorn fans for 'Star Wars' fans."
Solo,Solo_rm,132,"The first act is glacial, the extended universe connections weak and the entire concept and execution of L3 abysmal. But Ron Howard's cliffhanger confidence in the action and the smoky, alluring cinematography from Bradford Young carry it through."
Solo,Solo_rm,133,"While Solo is not the greatest Star Wars film, it is certainly a good one."
Solo,Solo_rm,134,I recommend [Solo: A Star Wars Story] if you have enjoyed the previous entries. [Full Review in Spanish]
Solo,Solo_rm,135,"Compared to the other Disney offerings in the franchise, Solo is the most consistent."
Solo,Solo_rm,136,Solo: A Star Wars Story is a film designed for complacency in particular for the thousands of fans who clutch Star Wars to their heart. [Full Review in Spanish]
Solo,Solo_rm,137,"The only disappointment about Solo, in fact, is Solo. It's not Ehrenreich's fault...he's an actor, not a celebrity impersonator, and he cannot be blamed for our disappointment..."
Solo,Solo_rm,138,"Everything about Solo seems just plain tired, from Ron Howard's rudimentary direction to the more-of-the-same/ incessant score to the murky cinematography."
Solo,Solo_rm,139,"Ron Howard has ensured that Solo is no embarrassment to the franchise, but the chases and hair's breadth escapes become a little tiresome in a less coherent second half."
Solo,Solo_rm,140,"This popcorn Star Wars prequel is light, funny and entertaining for the most part, unlike the previous, heavy, serious, tragic prequel, 'Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,' but nevertheless, it seems pretty sleight, with thin characterizations."
Solo,Solo_rm,141,This is franchise film-making at its worst.
Solo,Solo_rm,142,"Solo is entertaining but never compelling. Given the troubled production history, though, that still counts as a win."
Solo,Solo_rm,143,"Solo's blockbuster burden is heavy, but as ""a Star Wars story,"" it succeeds: Han shoots first, and most of us go home happy."
Solo,Solo_rm,144,"Franchise fatigue is real and it's acutely felt in a galaxy far, far away."
Solo,Solo_rm,145,"A modest yet fun movie full of energetic action sequences, great special effects and efficient performances. [Full review in Spanish]"
Solo,Solo_rm,146,Solo fleshes out a solid past for a guy who learns to trust less and still has enough goodness within to join up with a galactic rebellion later
Solo,Solo_rm,147,"Director Ron Howard breathes new life into a franchise that had grown tired and repetitive...The story is good enough to survive if it were set in our galaxy, on our little planet, in today's time."
Solo,Solo_rm,148,"A film comprised entirely of information whose significance was determined decades ago, ""Solo"" explores events that shaped Han Solo, but seems actively at war with itself over how much to humanize the most irresistible rogue in the galaxy."
Solo,Solo_rm,149,"It's no The Last Jedi, but it's fun, exciting, and quite entertaining, a combo that is made all the more impressive given the long, bumpy, and nearly-disastrous road that it took to finally come to the screen."
Solo,Solo_rm,150,"(Ehrenreich) does emulate the actor and the character of Han, and it doesn't take long to accept him as a younger model... with a familiar knowing smirk that informs him as a good guy among bad guys... even if not law-abiding."
Solo,Solo_rm,151,"Firmly rooted within the Star Wars universe, thanks largely to a script by Lawrence Kasdan, who knows this universe intimately, and knows how to write Han."
Solo,Solo_rm,152,"What in Alden Ehrenreich's resume convinced someone he could be the next Han Solo! Star making role that just fizzled. But long live Chewy."
Solo,Solo_rm,153,"The picture is zippy enough to almost earn a recommendation. But while those folks who love all things Star Wars regardless of quality will adore it, those of us who grew up with the franchise and find it still rooted in our DNA deserved something better."
Solo,Solo_rm,154,"It's ... fine."
Solo,Solo_rm,155,"File Solo under 'Frivolous Fan Fiction.' ... The starship streaking into light speed here is strictly the millennials' Falcon."
Solo,Solo_rm,156,A mostly successful adventure with a few great action sequences and memorable new characters.
Solo,Solo_rm,157,"How could they do this to a good joe like Chewie? They've turned him into a wonky Wookiee enslaved by incompetents in a universe of stifling mediocrity."
Solo,Solo_rm,158,"SOLO: A STAR WARS STORY is well-rendered, fun, and exciting, hitting many of the nostalgic touchstones of those earliest films, while introducing a story all its own, and well worth your summer box-office bucks."
Solo,Solo_rm,159,"Solo: A Star Wars Story is a ricocheting experience of highs and lows, and the end result doesn't inspire any real extreme reaction."
Solo,Solo_rm,160,"Even at a stretched two hours, the whole thing feels like an aside - a small, low-stakes story stripped of the mythos and epic scale that make the new crop of Star Wars films land."
Solo,Solo_rm,161,"If you're going to make a film that is essentially a narrative colouring-in exercise, you might as well make it zippy and fun - and that's precisely what director Ron Howard delivers."
Solo,Solo_rm,162,"Out of all of the prequels set before ""A New Hope,"" I would definitely say that ""Solo"" is my favorite..."
Solo,Solo_rm,163,"[H]as its faults, but works fine as a buoyant popcorn flick with a charismatic lead [and his] close calls, barbed quips, and vast swaths of deeply satisfying swagger, the which Eherenreich pulls off with a nifty nonchalance."
Solo,Solo_rm,164,"Finally, Han Solo's origin film is satisfying enough with its nicely executed and elaborate actions sequences... [Full review in Spanish]"
Solo,Solo_rm,165,"Solo is fun, flawed and ultimately forgettable. It's an amiable popcorn adventure... and sometimes that's all you need."
Solo,Solo_rm,166,There is not much of this narrative prelude to praise... [Full review in Spanish]
Solo,Solo_rm,167,"At any rate, Solo: A Star Wars Story is worthy entertainment (and is even very solid in its second half)... [Full review in Spanish]"
Solo,Solo_rm,168,Solo works as a window to classic cinema. [Full Review in Spanish]
Solo,Solo_rm,169,"If you've ever wondered who Han Solo was and where he came from - this scruffy, adventurous prequel supplies the answers."
Solo,Solo_rm,170,"Han and Chewie heading into warp speed (then flashback) might have provided the early bolt the first act sorely needs. Still. it's an OK space vehicle for anyone but 'Star Wars' junkies likely expecting a better ride."
Solo,Solo_rm,171,"Works as a heist movie, less successful as an origin story."
Solo,Solo_rm,172,"Lucasfilm is once again playing it safe with its post-George Lucas movies, giving up what might have been a riskier, more surprising film."
Solo,Solo_rm,173,"This Star Wars prequel comes down to the charm and charisma of its characters, who are ... adequate."
Solo,Solo_rm,174,"As for the debts with the past, 'Han Solo' manages to unfold the most recognizable qualities of its iconic protagonist... [Full review in Spanish]"
Solo,Solo_rm,175,"In short, the story of Solo... turns out to be an entertaining film, but one that does not show the stars in their entirety. [Full review in Spanish]"
Solo,Solo_rm,176,"Overall, 'Solo: A Star Wars Story' is a great time at the cinema and really gives Han Solo the spotlight he deserves."
Solo,Solo_rm,177,"Ron Howard delivers a rip roarin' single in the Star Wars saga with this entertaining origin story of Han Solo, Chewy, and Lando."
Solo,Solo_rm,178,"It wasn't necessary to fill in all the gaps about Han Solo's life before Luke Skywalker enlists his help in a Tattooine cantina, but the movie exists anyway, and it's a whole lot better than most cinematic prequels."
Solo,Solo_rm,179,"A strong cast and the beginnings of a compelling story are wasted by what is, whichever director or directors is responsible, some of the worst filmmaking in Star Wars history"
Solo,Solo_rm,180,"If a robot... is the most charismatic character, something is wrong. [Full review in Spanish]"
Solo,Solo_rm,181,The star of the film is its black director of photography Bradford Young.
Solo,Solo_rm,182,The largely adorable cast is one of the only things about Solo that works particularly well.
Solo,Solo_rm,183,"By the end of this safe, bland origin story, one will walk away feeling entertained, but without having learnt anything surprising-or even interesting-about one of the franchise's most important characters."
Solo,Solo_rm,184,"This is a solid addition to the Star Wars series, with enough action to keep younger viewers in their seats. It doesn't add a lot to the story, but neither does it diminish it."
Solo,Solo_rm,185,"Taking its cues from the superhero origin story, Solo goes to great lengths to do fan service over its two-hour running time. For the rest, this prequel is a by-the-numbers entry in the franchise and easily the weakest film in the rebooted series."
Solo,Solo_rm,186,"Ehrenreich never seems to linger in a moment, find the right timing, or scratch a sniff of sincerity. For the most part, he's trapped somewhere between frat boy and fake soldier - which really isn't all that attractive."
Solo,Solo_rm,187,"With a fine balance of action and humour, the film leaves one yearning for more from the epic sci-fi saga."
Solo,Solo_rm,188,"Alden Ehrenreich makes for a likeable Han Solo. He doesn't ape the mannerisms of Harrison Ford, the original Solo but gets the spirit of the character right."
Solo,Solo_rm,189,"Curiously, the least interesting thing about the movie is the title character."
Solo,Solo_rm,190,"Considering its production history and the fact that most ""origin"" films are inherently blasé, ""Solo"" acquits itself quite nicely. Maybe it doesn't add a great deal to the mythology, but for fans of the space western genre, it's solid entertainment."
Solo,Solo_rm,191,"It's good enough. Like Rogue One, it features scene stealing droid. Train robbery sequence is a highlight. Kessel Run not so much."
Solo,Solo_rm,192,"Nothing in Solo can compete with a single scene in The Force Awakens. But what this film does have is cape-clad pilot Lando Calrissian (Donald Glover) and his pal, uppity droid L3-37 (Phoebe Waller-Bridge)."
Solo,Solo_rm,193,"If you're after slick action scenes, spectacular special effects and exhaustive explanations for every reference to a key character's past, this is the blockbuster you've been looking for."
Solo,Solo_rm,194,"SOLO takes the idea first explored in George Lucas' abominable prequels-explain away the magic-and runs it aground."
Solo,Solo_rm,195,"Satisfying, action-packed prequel explores Han's roots."
Solo,Solo_rm,196,"A fun couple of hours. Cowboys in space like Star Wars should be. Ehrenreich doesn't have Ford's natural swagger but his 84-tooth smile more than makes up for it."
Solo,Solo_rm,197,"This isn't The Force Awakens but proves about on par with the dreary Rogue One."
Solo,Solo_rm,198,"It's an against-the-odds triumph. But never tell him the odds."
Solo,Solo_rm,199,"Solo can't decide how many elements of the primary Star Wars narrative it wants to include, which translates into an uneasy mix of fan service and original thought."
Solo,Solo_rm,200,"The film is cohesive, zippy and confident to a fault, an interlocking piece of an ever-expanding - or should that be contracting - universe where most of the spontaneity has been relegated to the bad press."
Solo,Solo_rm,201,"I doubt many people were hankering for this to be made, but it's a pretty good b-movie."
Solo,Solo_rm,202,"If you've liked most if not all of the previous entries in this movie universe, you're probably going to be entertained. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, etc. - also Available)"
Solo,Solo_rm,203,"Breezy and forgettable, Solo reveals the franchise coasting on autopilot with only one woke character to spoil the fun."
Solo,Solo_rm,204,"Han is a character that is all about living on the edge, playing the risk/reward angles. And this film doesn't take enough risks to be completely rewarding."
Solo,Solo_rm,205,"These auxiliary tales are starting to look less and less like true standalone efforts, picking up the bad habits of one too many convenient tie-ins from their MCU cousins."
Solo,Solo_rm,206,"...A fun and exciting, though imperfect, addition to the Star Wars array. 'Solo' is well worth seeing, particularly for fans."
Solo,Solo_rm,207,"If the resulting film isn't as zesty as The Last Jedi, it at least provides a solid night of thrills and chills - which was what George Lucas's original Star Wars was supposed to be about, anyway."
Solo,Solo_rm,208,"Solo is at its best when it's uncoupled from all that heavy lifting, just crammed in a cockpit with its likeable cast and shooting for the stars."
Solo,Solo_rm,209,"The story may be slight but it's propulsive enough and enjoyable enough to be a fine Star Wars movie in its own right - a far cry from the sterile prequels it invokes in a sop to younger fans."
Solo,Solo_rm,210,"It's a rite-of-passage movie about what it takes this free spirited rebel - a reckless kid more concerned with impressing a girl rather than igniting the spark that will eventually fuel the rebellion - to become the character we know and love."
Solo,Solo_rm,211,"While the film is titled, ""Solo: A Star Wars Story"" it should have been called ""Solo and Chewie: A Star Wars Bromance"" because it is their relationship that is the heart and soul of this story."
Solo,Solo_rm,212,"If if offers nothing new, it does what it does with craft and skill."
Solo,Solo_rm,213,The film is at its thriving best when the screen is filled by the potpourri of personality that orbits the pivotal pilot of the title.
Solo,Solo_rm,214,"Even if most of the plot's twists and turns are fairly obvious, it's amusing to watch the balance of power shift between the characters. And no one is just along for the ride."
Solo,Solo_rm,215,"Ron Howard's prequel has enough to satisfy the cognoscenti and the dabbler alike."
Solo,Solo_rm,216,"Howard lends his expertise as a narrator, but deploys a staging and assembly without spark or claw. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Solo,Solo_rm,217,"Solo: A Star Wars Story is a swift breeze, cheerful and exhilarating, without feeling too long or exhausting."
Solo,Solo_rm,218,"It's telling to note the most compelling characters are Donald Glover's Lando and Emilia Clarke's Qi'ra in a film that's supposed to be spotlighting Han Solo."
Solo,Solo_rm,219,"Solo shows that Rogue One was not a fluke. There are stories to be told in the Star Wars universe that don't have to advance the main saga."
Solo,Solo_rm,220,The Ron Howard-directed origin story lacks the thrills expected from watching a young Han Solo scraping by in the galaxy.
Solo,Solo_rm,221,"We want our Star Wars movies to resonate and stay with us... and the more I thought about Solo, the more I disliked it. That's not to say that it's without a few highlights, but I find it a little bothersome."
Solo,Solo_rm,222,This is a lively affair with treats for fans and a barrage of entertainment for all.
Solo,Solo_rm,223,"If you're going to introduce a prequel to the Star Wars saga in a different way than anyone has tried before, you'd better deliver the goods. Solo does exactly that. I think the magic key can be summed up in one word: casting."
Solo,Solo_rm,224,"In the end, Solo is a planet-hopping action romp that hits the ground running and rarely hits the breaks. And it comes with a scene almost as good as Rogue One's Darth Vader moment."
Solo,Solo_rm,225,One senses that completing production was the primary accomplishment to the exclusion of those virtues that made Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back so transporting.
Solo,Solo_rm,226,"Imagine you have all the money in the world. You can tell any story you want! Nobody to stop you. No one. And what you give a hypothetically eager audience is Ron Howard's Solo."
Solo,Solo_rm,227,"It doesn't feel like a cohesive piece, so while it's at times charming, and does get off the ground in the last act, the getting there is extremely bumpy."
Solo,Solo_rm,228,"Tons of people are going to be entertained by this movie, but it didn't really justify its existence beyond making money."
Solo,Solo_rm,229,"This is just a heist movie, an origin of Han Solo and an explanation of the character we all love. And I am here for it...it could have been a lot better than it was, but I expected it to be worse."
Solo,Solo_rm,230,The best - and worst thing - you can say about Solo: A Star Wars Story is that it is a fun throwback.
Solo,Solo_rm,231,"With Ron Howard at the wheel, the film becomes a galactic western with a good dosis of humor and adventure. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Solo,Solo_rm,232,Solo is the first indication of a future where the movies in this saga become exercises in obligatory commercialism that contain no amount of creative spark. [Full Review in Spanish]
Solo,Solo_rm,233,"Howard knows how to make the film move. But for all the characters, chases, card games, twists and turns, the story itself is surprisingly ordinary, and even a little dull at times."
Solo,Solo_rm,234,"Yes, these are all important moments in Han's formative years, but onscreen they are average and often pedestrian."
Solo,Solo_rm,235,"As for actually understanding and seeing how Han turns ... into the character we already know, these are, apparently, matters for later."
Solo,Solo_rm,236,My main beef is that there is no sense of originality despite it being an origin story.
Solo,Solo_rm,237,A dizzyingly effervescent spectacle that reminded me precisely why I fell in love with Star Wars as a child.
Solo,Solo_rm,238,"As disconcerting as the film's start is... it takes off like the Millennium Falcon in its second half. [Full review in Spanish]"
Solo,Solo_rm,239,"It may not look like much, but it's got it where it counts, kid."
Solo,Solo_rm,240,"There's nothing here like the wince-inducing dialogue or wooden acting of George Lucas's prequel trilogy. On the other hand, there's nothing like their visionary quality either."
Solo,Solo_rm,241,"Considering all the turmoil behind it, Solo: A Star Wars Story has no business being as good as it is."
Solo,Solo_rm,242,"A tedious, overlong and insipid bore with no emotional core nor any palpable thrills."
Solo,Solo_rm,243,"The best thing about ""Solo"" is its tight script, filled with interesting twists and double-crosses all the way to the end."
Solo,Solo_rm,244,Solo is an effective and entertaining space western...
Solo,Solo_rm,245,"A rollicking, entertaining entry in the storied franchise."
Solo,Solo_rm,246,The formula is strong with this one.
Solo,Solo_rm,247,"Solo: A Star Wars Story delivers exactly what it promises. It is a very competent and, at times, riotously enjoyable film. If that is all you want your Star Wars to be, then you'll go home happy enough."
Solo,Solo_rm,248,The early life of Han Solo unfolds in this action-filled galactic western.
Solo,Solo_rm,249,The action is surprisingly disappointing. Most of the blockbuster moments feature so many fast cuts that there is none of the epic quality that is a mainstay of the franchise. With no tension or sense of menace these scenes drag rather than exhilarate.
Solo,Solo_rm,250,"""Solo: A Star Wars Story"" isn't necessary in the grand scheme of all things ""Star Wars."""
Solo,Solo_rm,251,"It's fine, and occasionally even inspired, with a couple of set pieces finding the playful energy a young Han movie should have by the barrelful."
Solo,Solo_rm,252,"A fun, fast-paced adventure, chockablock with gadgets and action yet populated by characters we care about."
Solo,Solo_rm,253,"It turns out there's room for some swashbuckling in a galaxy far, far away as ""Solo"" shoots first and sweats the details later."
Solo,Solo_rm,254,An adventure that lacks poetry but succeeds as popcorn entertainment.
Solo,Solo_rm,255,"There is a rote quality to Solo: A Star Wars Story that not only undercuts many of these thrills, but runs directly counter to the spirit of Han Solo."
Solo,Solo_rm,256,"Solo probably won't top anyone's list of their favorite Star Wars movies, and if you're looking for any surprises, you've come to the wrong place. But that doesn't mean it's not a whole lot of fun."
Solo,Solo_rm,257,"While everyone who isn't named ""Han"" is short shrifted, Ehrenreich gets a really good grip on the character from the get-go, and watching him fumble and flail through his adventures is immensely enjoyable."
Solo,Solo_rm,258,"There's no heavy lifting to be done here, just have fun with the material. And yet fun is oddly lacking...There's nothing terrible about Solo. It can be spectacular, it can be charming, but it lacks sparkle."
Solo,Solo_rm,259,"An annual Star Wars film might have been the childhood dream of many of us, but Solo suggests otherwise."
Solo,Solo_rm,260,"Ron Howard may be the person that Disney claims saved Solo, but it's a salvage job that proves less than endearing."
Solo,Solo_rm,261,"Where Harrison Ford brought humor, sex appeal, and depth to Han Solo, Alden Ehrenreich brings an arched eyebrow, an idiot's grin, and the sex appeal of seaweed."
Solo,Solo_rm,262,"It doesn't achieve greatness, but it's certainly not the disappointment many expected it to be."
Solo,Solo_rm,263,"Like Han Solo himself, Solo is rough around the edges. Under the grime, though, is a fun romp through space that's more lighthearted than you might expect from Star Wars."
Solo,Solo_rm,264,"As a B-movie, ""Solo"" delivers, sometimes in a way that reminds a viewer of this franchise's roots in classic Saturday matinee adventure serials and sometimes simply as proficient, dutiful, time-passing entertainment."
Solo,Solo_rm,265,"As long as it sticks to that straightforward action-adventure premise, Solo is a blast."
Solo,Solo_rm,266,"It's weighed down by so much unnecessary fan service, but on the bright side, that means the sequel will automatically be better."
Solo,Solo_rm,267,"By and large, Howard delivers, although he does so in a typically Ron Howardesque manner, with a solid movie that is eminently watchable, but very much in the realms of ""good"" rather than ""great."""
Solo,Solo_rm,268,"The new movie has been described as a space western, but I think it's more like a pirate movie - and almost pure fun from start to finish."
Solo,Solo_rm,269,"If you think of it as an isolated action movie, however, it's a lot of fun."
Solo,Solo_rm,270,"Solo is a closer cousin to the original source material, than to the new crop of trilogies and standalone films."
Solo,Solo_rm,271,"A thoroughly reliable addition to the 'Star Wars' corpus, closely mimicking the spirit of the first two movies in the series if not managing to recapture their magic."
Solo,Solo_rm,272,"Could Solo, like Rogue One, become something deeper than an appeal to nostalgia? As it turns out, the answer's no."
Solo,Solo_rm,273,"Han Solo is no longer one of Star Wars' most enigmatic characters - he emerges from this film with enough backstory to satisfy the most dim-witted armchair psychoanalyst."
Solo,Solo_rm,274,"Solo is efficient entertainment and no more than that, but it's also no less."
Solo,Solo_rm,275,"But the neutral news about ""Solo"" is exactly that, its dramatic neutrality. Time ticks by at a drifty pace while lots of action of no great consequence grinds on."
Solo,Solo_rm,276,"Certainly one of the most romantic of the 10 films so far. But it's also spotted with doughy patches, heavy info dumps and battle scenes that aren't quite coherent."
Solo,Solo_rm,277,"Solo: A Star Wars Story is engineered to be vigorously cute and unflappably charming, so there are plenty of little bits that brighten the experience throughout, but they add up to a mountain of mostly nothing."
Solo,Solo_rm,278,"The movie generates a decent amount of good will, and after a couple of hours under the hood, Howard gets it running."
Solo,Solo_rm,279,Although it strongly embraces a sense of fun and derring-do...Depth of emotion is not its strong suit.
Solo,Solo_rm,280,"a proficient, well-made film with some moments of genuine inspiration, even if it likely won't set the world on fire."
Solo,Solo_rm,281,"Regardless, Solo is a good time at the movies, even if Howard should not have helmed it."
Solo,Solo_rm,282,"There's no denying that Solo: A Star Wars Story is, for the most part, an absolute blast."
Solo,Solo_rm,283,"The heavy Star Wars legacy sits lightly on Mr. Ehrenreich's shoulders in a Disney-Lucasfilm movie that is finally having fun."
Solo,Solo_rm,284,"Not as strong with the force, this one is."
Solo,Solo_rm,285,"It may not be one of the best Star Wars movies, but viewed as a sci-fi summer blockbuster, it's a blast."
Solo,Solo_rm,286,"The director(s) left Han in the background. The iconic Solo deserved a better origin story. A seasoned actor would have demanded more presence and not a hobbled, wimpy love story. A typical Ron Howard movie lacking passion."
Solo,Solo_rm,287,"A Star Wars-flavored juice drink* of a movie (*contains 10% real juice) that tells us nothing of significance we didn't already know about Han Solo, in an incarnation that lacks his essential charisma and precarious danger."
Solo,Solo_rm,288,A breezy summer entertainment that benefits from high spirits and low expectations.
Solo,Solo_rm,289,Solo: a movie no one was clamoring for that has been made without any distinguishing qualities.
Solo,Solo_rm,290,This is a film that prefers the version of Han Solo where Greedo shoots first.
Solo,Solo_rm,291,"As Han himself might say: 'I have a bad feeling about this'. But any rough edges resulting from the abrupt change of director have been entirely smoothed over."
Solo,Solo_rm,292,STAR WARS films will forever be entertaining --- they incorporate so many feelings --- and so much humor. SOLO: A STAR WARS STORY is no exception --- looking forward to the next.
Solo,Solo_rm,293,"Anchored by a strong, even heroic performance from Alden Ehrenreich who manages to accomplish the near impossible --- do justice to the iconic character perfected by Harrison Ford. Otherwise, SOLO is pretty standard stuff."
Solo,Solo_rm,294,"A lighthearted and enjoyable Star Wars adventure film. Alden Ehrenreich shines, exceeding unfair expectations. [Full review in Spanish]"
Solo,Solo_rm,295,"Solo is a space Western, more or less, and the more it leans into that model, the more fun it is."
Solo,Solo_rm,296,"Most of me really loves this movie, but the Star Wars fan inside just can't."
Solo,Solo_rm,297,"How does a movie about the galaxy's most dashingly roguish outlaw end up being the safest Star Wars to date?"
Solo,Solo_rm,298,"It may not be necessary, but it is most welcome...fits as satisfyingly into the ""Star Wars"" universe as that last piece in a jigsaw puzzle."
Solo,Solo_rm,299,"There are times when Solo: A Star Wars Story gets it right, and all the measures of Cool that generations have adored and emulated positively glow on the big screen with an eye twinkle and naughty grin."
Solo,Solo_rm,300,"Avait-on vraiment besoin de voir tout ça? Probablement pas. Mais pour ce qu'il est, Solo livre relativement la marchandise. [Full review in French]"
Solo,Solo_rm,301,"Solo tied me out with a lengthy action sequence about three-quarters of the way through, but overall the origins story of Han Solo proves an entertaining enough addition to the Star Wars galaxy to drown out quibbles."
Solo,Solo_rm,302,"The charm in Solo comes more from the cast than the story. It's a rogue's gallery of likeable characters."
Solo,Solo_rm,303,[Solo: A Star Wars Story] manages to distance itself from failed attempts into the darkness of the saga and returns with product that cannot fail to gain the empathy of the public. [Full Review in Spanish]
Solo,Solo_rm,304,"Ron Howard, who picked up the reins [from Lord and Miller], has delivered a seamless, planet-hopping adventure that charts Han's beginnings as a desperate street urchin with big dreams through his rascally acquisition of his famous ship."
Solo,Solo_rm,305,Like expensively produced fan fiction that is entertaining enough but never quite manages to find its own footing to stand on its own.
Solo,Solo_rm,306,"A slam-bang action movie that never quits moving, but more than that, it creates an authentic universe."
Solo,Solo_rm,307,"These are some big space shoes to fill. But hey, give the new Han some room to grow--to become Solo--and he grows on you."
Solo,Solo_rm,308,"It's not that it's terrible, but it certainly falls into the take-it-or-leave-it category with its mediocre plotting, inconsistent characterisation and regrettable writing. It was decidedly underwhelming and definitely too long."
Solo,Solo_rm,309,"At times, ""adequate,"" save for the lead, who is miscast"
Solo,Solo_rm,310,After a wobbly start it works fairly well...with enough for [Star Wars] geeks and non-geeks alike.
Solo,Solo_rm,311,"It's cool that Solo: A Star Wars Story lets you know how Han met Chewbacca and Lando. But that's just enough intrigue to fill a trailer -- not a feature film."
Solo,Solo_rm,312,"It's clear that [Alden] Ehrenreich is from from having the charisma of the young Harrison Ford, but he manages... [Full Review in Spanish]"
Solo,Solo_rm,313,"Han Solo dedicates a lot of space to those little details, and that's why (among other things) it's not the disaster that was predicted until now. [Full review in Spanish]"
Solo,Solo_rm,314,"I'm not sure who ultimately deserves the credit given the director change but Solo: A Star Wars Story, as a finished product, is an entertaining film."
Solo,Solo_rm,315,"Like Rogue One before it, Solo: A Star Wars Story brings elevated expectations for future Star Wars spin-offs back down to Earth. Except when it comes to a vehicle for Lando. Now there's a new hope."
Solo,Solo_rm,316,"There's some fun to be had, but it's lacking in stakes, energy and depth. Alden Ehrenreich delivers a solid performance, but the movie overall doesn't add all that much to the character."
Solo,Solo_rm,317,"There's a whole galaxy out there, but Ron Howard doesn't seem to realise it. His Han Solo prequel is a pedestrian journey through a series of inconsequential set-pieces, where character development of its iconic protagonist is stuck to the surface."
Solo,Solo_rm,318,"[A] lot better than fans had any right to expect, but it is not the ripping yarn we collectively yearned for."
Solo,Solo_rm,319,"No one had to squeeze their brain in order to present the 20-something Han Solo. Everything is mechanic, routine and the only thing remotely shocking is that it used shockingly dark photography on a story meant to be bright. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Solo,Solo_rm,320,"Solo is not the disaster that many feared... it's very much a film of good bits and bad bits."
Solo,Solo_rm,321,It would take a disaster the size of an exploding Death Star to bump Menace from the place as the worst Star Wars movie. Solo comes in second.
Solo,Solo_rm,322,So it turns out Han Solo may have a lot in common with your grandparents.
Solo,Solo_rm,323,"A pure dose of adrenalin and joy straight to the heart, Solo has kickstarted a whole new corner of the Star Wars universe, and I can't wait to go back again."
Solo,Solo_rm,324,"It's a smorgasbord of fanservice moments that practically look directly into the camera and wink, but each time it happens, the gesture gets less and less endearing."
Solo,Solo_rm,325,A high-spirited adventure that reminds us why we all fell in love with Star Wars in the first place.
Solo,Solo_rm,326,"Unlike The Last Jedi, it contains no moments when one questions the sanity of the writers, or why, with so many resources and so much talent at their fingertips, they resorted to egregious twists built on flaky or even non-existent logic."
Solo,Solo_rm,327,"...the Old West with the serial numbers filed off and a light dusting of spaceships, droids, and Wookiees."
Solo,Solo_rm,328,"The action zips along, with the help of some predictably terrific special effects, but as a whole it feels more functional than exhilarating."
Solo,Solo_rm,329,"The middle 80 per cent is a great ride, real edge-of-your-seat, seat-of-your-pants adventure; hence the four-out-of-five stars."
Solo,Solo_rm,330,Solo is not a big-time Star Wars movie. It is a goodtime Star Wars movie.
Solo,Solo_rm,331,"I really like some of the additions we got...Paul Bettany works very well with Ron Howard, and he gave a hell of a performance in this."
Solo,Solo_rm,332,"The fans will most assuredly be appeased, and if nothing else, Han Solo will go down in Lucasfilm history as the movie that conclusively affirmed that humans can and do have sex with droids."
Solo,Solo_rm,333,The chemistry always worked...but I do think some plot points were kind of clunky and things dragged on for a while...
Solo,Solo_rm,334,Struck me as intellectual property unconvincingly arranged into the shape of a movie.
Solo,Solo_rm,335,"Think of Solo as you would its eponymous hero: a scruffy-looking, half-witted nerf-herder of a film that's not bad to look at, and oh-so devilishly fun."
Solo,Solo_rm,336,"""Solo: A Star Wars Story"" is a blast. A thoroughly satisfying, unusually fresh entry with a restless, free-wheeling aura and plenty of heart."
Solo,Solo_rm,337,An unrelenting thrill-ride with little respite.
Solo,Solo_rm,338,"Ehrenreich manages to make Han Solo his own while never betraying the character's legacy. Have no fear, this far, far away galaxy is still in great shape."
Solo,Solo_rm,339,"If anything, Solo proves the spin-off side is far more daring, creative and respectful for fans who don't want their Star Wars memories treated like Bantha poodoo."
Solo,Solo_rm,340,A bland heist movie in space that does nothing unexpected and never justifies its existence.
Solo,Solo_rm,341,"Whether shooting down TIE fighters or squeezing through constricted black holes, the action is relentless and top notch while hewing to the George Lucas formula of old."
Solo,Solo_rm,342,"Solo, like the Falcon in Empire, tends to sputter just when it should leap into hyperdrive."
Solo,Solo_rm,343,"Its flawed central performance ultimately makes ""Solo"" a distinct disappointment."
Solo,Solo_rm,344,"Watching a bromance that you're already super invested in blossom before your eyes is genuinely heart-warming."
Solo,Solo_rm,345,The rest is nothing more than a compendium of action scenes filmed in a pedestrian way and without inspiration. [Full review in Spanish]
Solo,Solo_rm,346,"In short, neither more nor less than a fun robbery movie, perhaps a missed opportunity, and certainly a catastrophe avoided. [Full review in Spanish]"
Solo,Solo_rm,347,"But no one need worry about Solo: A Star Wars Story upsetting the apple cart, or indeed the landspeeder: it does exactly what you might predict a prequel featuring Harrison Ford's iconic space-scoundrel would do."
Solo,Solo_rm,348,To say that Solo: A Star Wars Story is devoid of ideas is an understatement.
Solo,Solo_rm,349,"The excitement picks up in the second half, when the film slows down enough so that we can have some feeling for the characters."
Solo,Solo_rm,350,The only thing this version of Han would do first to Greedo is bore him to death.
Solo,Solo_rm,351,"Might have looked more at home on the smaller screen... It's a pedestrian affair, visually flat and dingy, with a plot that amounts to a lot of to-ing and fro-ing without establishing very much."
Solo,Solo_rm,352,"Designed to be safe, familiar, and smile-inducing."
Solo,Solo_rm,353,One of the lighter of the Star Wars adventures... entertaining as hell but not particularly deep.
Solo,Solo_rm,354,Cosmos-crashing hokum high on adrenaline and low on visual impact.
Solo,Solo_rm,355,"Solo: A Star Wars Story hits all the expected Han Solo origin story beats, delivering a solidly entertaining experience with few surprises."
Solo,Solo_rm,356,"Director Ron Howard ... delivers serviceable goods ... ensuring that this long-running intergalactic series will continue, for better or for worse, into the foreseeable future."
Solo,Solo_rm,357,"It's tantalizing to wonder what the film that Miller and Lord would have been. Might it have offered a promising glimpse of what a less boilerplate ""Star Wars"" might look like?"
Solo,Solo_rm,358,"""Solo"" is the worst ""Star Wars"" movie ever released"
Solo,Solo_rm,359,"Less a movie, more a colouring in exercise."
Solo,Solo_rm,360,"The movie's light tone of an uncompromising and humorous adventure may reflect the fact this is the first film in the series to be completely free of the drama of the most problematic family in the galaxy."
Solo,Solo_rm,361,"As a standalone movie this is a hell of a lot of fun, with just enough of the old-school Star Wars magic to satisfy the die hards."
Solo,Solo_rm,362,"So much that weighs down the franchise isn't here yet: no Death Star, no use of the Force. This one's a straight up space cowboy heist movie."
Solo,Solo_rm,363,I think the comedy version of Solo could have worked.
Solo,Solo_rm,364,"An entertaining and often thrilling exercise in fan service, Solo checks off all the expected boxes."
Solo,Solo_rm,365,"After a bumpy start, Ron Howard's prequel settles in and takes us on an entertaining enough ride. There's one great actor in it. And it isn't Alden Ehrenreich."
Solo,Solo_rm,366,"Solo is a fun ride for sure, but it feels too commercial. It is the least epic installment of the Star Wars franchise."
Solo,Solo_rm,367,"Solo, the latest entry in the Lucasfilm franchise, brings Star Wars back to earth with a Millennium Falcon-rattling bump."
Solo,Solo_rm,368,"It's no minor accomplishment that the movie is making its targeted May 25 release date and borderline miraculous that it isn't a total disaster."
Solo,Solo_rm,369,"Solo is the first Star Wars film in recent memory that feels like it's selling something."
Solo,Solo_rm,370,"Things do feel shaky at first, but there's spunk to [Alden] Ehrenreich's delivery and, once he settles in, a twinkle in his eye."
Solo,Solo_rm,371,"Ehrenreich hasn't failed Solo: A Star Wars Story. The truth, I daresay, is exactly the opposite."
Solo,Solo_rm,372,"No doubt Harrison Ford's Han Solo would casually dismiss this adequately fun origin story with a wink and a wry smile."
Solo,Solo_rm,373,"It's got a couple of gasps, a lot of action and a built-in Star Wars audience, pretty much everything a movie needs except one: a compelling reason for being."
Solo,Solo_rm,374,"It's a dazzling affair that captures the whimsy and tactility of the original trilogy arguably better than any of the other Disney-era Star Wars flicks."
Solo,Solo_rm,375,Solo is also the most lighthearted and fun film so far in the expanded Star Wars universe.
Solo,Solo_rm,376,"Strip away the nostalgia, the familiar Star Wars backdrop and take it for what it's worth, and ""Solo"" is a bit of a clunker."
Solo,Solo_rm,377,"Best of all, the movie is different."
Solo,Solo_rm,378,"It's checklist mythology, but thankfully served up with enough panache to make the trip engaging."
Solo,Solo_rm,379,No light sabres are on display and nor is there any sign of Darth Vader but Solo: A Star Wars delivers exactly what you want and expect from a movie about the young Han Solo.
Solo,Solo_rm,380,"""Solo"" is not an awful movie, it just has a few awful parts that feel uninspired."
Solo,Solo_rm,381,"It's ""How I Met Your Wookiee""!"
Solo,Solo_rm,382,Things fall into place too easily. Intensity is in short supply. I dub this movie Soso.
Solo,Solo_rm,383,"Solo is pretty, but it's a desolate place to be."
Solo,Solo_rm,384,"Solo: A Star Wars Storyis a film that gives us Han Solo's cinematic origin story while staying true to the original Star Wars trilogy."
Solo,Solo_rm,385,"""Solo: A Star Wars Story"" gets the job done with little fuss, but also with precious little finesse."
Solo,Solo_rm,386,"Solo is technically a Star Wars movie, but it's one that has set pieces in place of a personality. It's a film whose base level is ""fine"". Despite some unique cinematography, Ron Howard's direction is staid, stolid, and completely without personality."
Solo,Solo_rm,387,"Howard and the Kasdans play the series game without ever raising the stakes, defaulting to dull and dutiful when they might have blasted off into creative anarchy."
Solo,Solo_rm,388,"Far better than we had any right to expect. Thrilling set-pieces, spine-tingling iconography and a Han/Chewie bromance to savour."
Solo,Solo_rm,389,Solo: A Star Wars Story is a great heist movie and an underwhelming origin story.
Solo,Solo_rm,390,"A slick, swift-footed adventure which plays like a planet-hopping heist movie."
Solo,Solo_rm,391,"Although the action can feel at times curiously low-stakes, Solo: A Star Wars Story is an all-round diverting foray into a galaxy, far, far away which doesn't take itself too seriously."
Solo,Solo_rm,392,"A spectacularly exciting journey with terrific casting and loads of fan service that will honestly probably make even novices with the lore smile, but the prequels do need to find a better middle ground between fan service and taking storytelling risks"
Solo,Solo_rm,393,"It's merely a solidly made, fun adventure in the company of familiar characters."
Solo,Solo_rm,394,"In an age when our blockbusters feel more pointlessly busy and somber than ever, [Solo] just might come as a relief."
Solo,Solo_rm,395,"Solo will please fans, if not necessarily astound them, and leave them anticipating how the story will connect with the original Star Wars saga."
Solo,Solo_rm,396,"Though ""Solo"" finishes with a satisfying sense of arrival, the movie leaves room for a sequel, and it may be the best measure of this movie's ultimate quality that the idea of another one of these sounds fun."
Solo,Solo_rm,397,"With [Ron] Howard at the controls, the movie is a fun-fuelled entertainment."
Solo,Solo_rm,398,"Solo is 'prequel bad,' and as anyone who really loves this franchise knows, there aren't a lot of things worse."
Solo,Solo_rm,399,"As an intergalactic adventure, it's mostly adequate, with some very successful elements, but if you stripped the Star Wars names and places, it's doubtful that it would spawn much excitement, let alone sequels."
Solo,Solo_rm,400,"Operating in a middle-ground register that's defined by its bland safeness, he sturdily shoulders the weight of the chaotic material...in a role that demands greatness, he is, in a word, okay."
Solo,Solo_rm,401,"A corporate directive made flesh, a quarterly earnings report in a vest and black leather boots."
Solo,Solo_rm,402,"Sorry, ""Star Wars"" fans: The first dud of the new series has arrived in ""Solo: A Star Wars Story."""
Solo,Solo_rm,403,"The imprint of Star Wars on everyday American life now feels so despotic that it's too much to ask a film like Solo to be moving or thrilling as a piece of cinema."
Solo,Solo_rm,404,"While Solo is a Star Wars movie that gambles on not really being a ""Star Wars movie,"" it's a winning chapter that only sparingly (though intriguingly) shows its hand in connecting to the bigger universe."
Solo,Solo_rm,405,"A fun, if lightweight space Western, made slightly serious by an equal rights - for humans, Wookiees, even droids - subtext."
Solo,Solo_rm,406,"Solo doesn't break new ground, but with an adventure this fun, that's just fine."
Solo,Solo_rm,407,"Overall, don't get a bad feeling about this. You may even laugh it up, fuzzball."
Solo,Solo_rm,408,"It may be a prequel, and it may ostensibly stand alone, but it fits into the wider galaxy with ease."
Solo,Solo_rm,409,An entertaining two-plus hours.
Solo,Solo_rm,410,"It gets off to a slow, muddy, grimly predictable start-but Solo is ultimately, thankfully, one of the good ones."
Solo,Solo_rm,411,"While ""Solo"" hasn't completely overcome the long odds, those harboring a love of the franchise should come away, ultimately, with a good feeling about this."
Solo,Solo_rm,412,"Solo is not a bad film, just a relentlessly average one that has no reason to exist."
Solo,Solo_rm,413,"""Solo"" is a straightforward piece of pulpy entertainment with some very agreeable performances from [Alden] Ehrenreich and [Donald] Glover, who seems to be having the most fun of all the actors..."
Solo,Solo_rm,414,The relationship between Lando and Han feels designed for a Star Wars generation that wants to see more between its characters - especially those embedded in Star Wars lore who might appear in the next decade of sequels.
Solo,Solo_rm,415,"Because it sets its sights lower, its aim is truer. It may not look like much - but it's got it where it counts."
Solo,Solo_rm,416,"This movie springboards off the flaws of Star Wars movies that have come before it, not the strengths... If new Star Wars movies are meant for a new generation, then I feel like a new generation deserves better than this."
Solo,Solo_rm,417,"There are things to like in SOLO, just not nearly enough of them."
Solo,Solo_rm,418,"Han's evolution in this movie is entirely superficial. He doesn't become the character we recognize."
Solo,Solo_rm,419,Ehrenreich is not the Han you are looking for.
Solo,Solo_rm,420,"It doesn't take itself too seriously, but it also holds whatever irreverent, anarchic impulses it might possess in careful check."
Solo,Solo_rm,421,"Solo: A Star Wars Story works both on its own merits as an exciting action spectacle and as an origin story for the franchise's favorite scoundrel."
Solo,Solo_rm,422,"For better or worse, this is the first STAR WARS movie that doesn't feel or play like an event."
Solo,Solo_rm,423,"I take a good portion of my naysaying back, and gladly: Solo was the first Star Wars movie in a long time that gave me anything like the light-hearted thrill I first felt seeing A New Hope as a kid."
Solo,Solo_rm,424,"It's the very definition of ""solid"" and ""competent."" Nothing more, nothing less."
Solo,Solo_rm,425,"A few quibbles are triggered along the way, but the adventure remains exciting and the performances satisfy immensely, giving the side mission some real charisma and ""Star Wars""-style hustle."
Solo,Solo_rm,426,"Solo: A Star Wars Story commits to being a charming and fun exercise in repackaging nostalgia and pre-owned protagonists. It's just too bad its script never fully committed to seeing through Han's arc ... to its preordained end."
Solo,Solo_rm,427,"The movie's real hero...is Howard. He managed to bring a fun, if slightly scuffed up, joyride into theaters - against the odds."
Solo,Solo_rm,428,"Though burdened with a slow start and enough thirsty fan-service to power Comic-Con's Hall H for a decade, it has a kicky, kinetic heist movie at its heart, and its action sequences are machine-tooled spectacles of the first order."
Solo,Solo_rm,429,"Once Solo gets cooking, it's as cohesive as Star Wars gets, and ultimately, that comes down to the script."
Solo,Solo_rm,430,"""Solo: A Star Wars Story"" has the makings of a rewatchable and enjoyable flick for a popcorn night. Unsure if this expands the base or isolates it all together."
Solo,Solo_rm,431,You can feel the two versions of Solo: A Star Wars Story tugging at each other throughout.
Solo,Solo_rm,432,"Chewbacca, I recognize. Lando Calrissian? He seems familiar. But this is not my Han Solo..."
Solo,Solo_rm,433,"As soon as I walked out of the theater after seeing Solo: A Star Wars Story, I wanted to see more."
Solo,Solo_rm,434,"Rather than try to mimic Ford's work beat-for-beat, Ehrenreich has found a way to make the role his own, and in doing so to show us this familiar character from a fresh perspective."
Solo,Solo_rm,435,"Howard's efficient, confident, slightly square direction does the job. It's his best film in a decade."
Solo,Solo_rm,436,"Despite the intermittent lags, the production proves to be more than a salvage operation thanks mainly to those engagingly choreographed performances, led by an irresistibly charismatic title turn from Alden Ehrenreich."
Solo,Solo_rm,437,"In his universally acceptable dreaminess and broad likability, Alden Ehrenreich is a walking hedge, a human limitation of risk. It's the movie star as politician. And that's not what I go to movies for."
Solo,Solo_rm,438,"Like estimations of how many parsecs it takes to make the Kessel Run, your mileage may vary when it comes to Solo: A Star Wars Story."
Solo,Solo_rm,439,"Entertaining, but heavy on the fan service-y and far too familiar."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,0,"What makes this homecoming fun is [Tom] Holland, who seems as excited about Spider-Man as his classmates even though he is Spider-Man."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,1,"If ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" is to be judged solely on its ability to unite a diverse audience behind a fun motion picture, it seems to have succeeded wildly."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,2,"A strangely oblivious film, one that undercuts its story with exactly the sort of praise-hungriness that its hero learns to overcome."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,3,A film that smuggles in a delightfully dorky high school saga under the banner of a too familiar superhero one.
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,4,"This is the Spidey movie we've been waiting for. It's also the best Spider-Man movie of the bunch."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,5,"An utter gas, a fast and very funny superflick that inserts Spidey into the larger Marvel Cinematic Universe without ever losing sight of what makes him unique and beloved."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,6,"Somewhere inside Homecoming, there is a better movie. A tighter, more effective one. The film we do have is fine, though, occasonally sluggish with an excellent performance from Tom Holland."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,7,"The laughs are genuine, but when it comes time for the inventive fight scenes to take place, the movie shines."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,8,Easily the best Spider-Man movie - ever.
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,9,"A good time, but not at the expense of your intelligence."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,10,"Spider-Man: Homecoming plays like a coming of age tale in an action-packed superhero setting, and gives us what is perhaps the best portrayal of its titular character."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,11,The script is really well done and if I was a teenager I would love this movie to pieces.
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,12,"[I]ts pervasive bubbly effervescence sets it apart from other depictions of the character (... ). Marvel's Peter Parker is young, bright and eager to participate."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,13,"Homecoming is so close to delivering a home run and one of the best superhero films in years, and it's a very hard film to quibble with."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,14,"Spider-Man: Homecoming is a winner through and through. It may not be the greatest Spider-Man film of all-time, but it just might be the best first solo outing in the MCU."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,15,Spider-Man: Homecoming is smart and sincere and dorky and fun in all the right ways.
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,16,"You root for Spider-Man / Peter Parker throughout the film, and you also get a great villain to boot, which is normally the MCU's biggest problem. I can't recommend it enough!"
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,17,Holland is the perfect Peter Parker.
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,18,Everything is derived. Spider-Man: Homecoming is a typical product of this annoyingly collaborative philosophy.
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,19,"Spider-Man: Homecoming rightly pulls back on the grandeur and delivers a fresh, sharp, and down-right wonderful piece of popcorn cinema."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,20,"[Holland} is just as funny and wise-cracking as you'd hope he'd be...he has a sort of earnestness ala Marty McFly that someone like Andrew Garfield could never quite capture."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,21,"Fresh, fun and fantastic."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,22,"What might have been an average movie with the wrong lead turns out to be an excellent vehicle for Holland's budding talent and Keaton's experienced charm."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,23,Another cog in a flimsy wheel
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,24,"Finally, the Spider-Man movie we've all been waiting for is here. And it delivers."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,25,"Not only is it a fun ride as a superhero romp, but the bubbly pace will also warrant multiple viewings. This is finally a fresh take on the classic hero. Welcome home, buddy."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,26,"We have never witnessed the ""friendly neighborhood Spider-Man"" like we see in the comics...until now ... (school and life problems make him) relatable."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,27,This is a bildungsroman with web shooters.
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,28,"Women and people of color exist at the margins of Homecoming, peeking in but never developing corporeal form."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,29,"The choice to make such a different story was a bold one, and it made for an exciting and fun film that has plenty of callbacks to Spidey's villains and the MCU while also feeling new and intriguing."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,30,"Yup. Marvel actually made Sony release a whole movie about the hero of their ""their"" superhero franchise begging Robert Downey Jr. to please, pretty-please, let him be in more of the Avengers movies."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,31,"Once the story is allowed to relax into itself by about the 30-minute mark, it's a funny and entertaining adventure with some good, but not overegged action sequences."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,32,"Lacking a bit of an emotional component present in some past Spider-Man movies, but makes up for it with sheer fun and entertainment value."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,33,"Jon Watts' vision doesn't top Sam Raimi's nor does his breezy fun times take on the character offer much in the way of substance."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,34,"This is without a doubt an amazing return for our legendary web-head, leaving great scope for an even greater future. Welcome home, Spidey."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,35,"This feels like the one I've been waiting for even if I didn't know it. Welcome home, Spidey. Hope you'll stick around for awhile."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,36,"It gives the character the fun and carefree attitude he's needed for years, but in grounding him so much from the larger Avengers action it robs him of his sincerity."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,37,"Welcome home, Spidey."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,38,Homecoming is one of the best Spider-Man films to date -- a delightful mix of the Marvel Universe and the world of John Hughes that has plenty of laughs and human elements mixed into the action.
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,39,"It might be the third reboot of the character in 15 years, but it also gives us the most appealing, fully-dimensional, and naturalistic Peter Parker yet."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,40,Tom Holland has been prepping for this role all his life and he absolutely nailed it in his first outing as the new webslinger.
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,41,"The MCU's most family-friendly installment."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,42,"Spider-Man: Homecoming reinvents the character for a new generation, while forgetting its roots."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,43,"I liked the movie quite a bit. It was longer than I would've liked...you really got to dive into [Peter Parker] and it genuinely felt like you were a part of his high school life."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,44,Maybe the best movie in the MCU so far? This cast is so great. These teens look like teens. This mix of high schoolers rings true. Why did this take so long?
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,45,"With a strong performance by Holland, ""Homecoming"" doesn't only incorporate Peter Parker to the MCU but provides a character driven story with humor & heart throughout."

SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,104,Spider-Man is fun again.

SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,127,"Peter is fallible and eager to a fault, with a lot to learn, but he is trying to be good, to save the day and to make the lives of others better. That's heroic."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,128,"Marvel has stumbled in the past by going too dark; Homecoming is an effervescent, witty, fun ride with a casually diverse -- culturally and in body type -- cast of teens to support."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,129,"A thoughtful, nimble argument for a more character-focused superhero movie, Spider-Man: Homecoming demonstrates what can be gained when the fate of the planet isn't at stake."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,130,"This film introduces us to a new, younger, more upbeat, lively Spider-Man and some good new characters, including a more complex, believable villain than one usually sees in these kinds of films."

SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,134,"The duration is frankly excessive and the final fight is the same old thing -confusing and without genuine cinematographic sense-, but these defects end up being lesser to the consistent good humor of the film. [Full review in Spanish]"
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,135,"Holland is one of the key elements here that makes this Jon-Watts-directed Marvel epic work so well, as his Spidey/Peter Parker is a nerdy high school student (just like in the original comics) who's full of goofy enthusiasm about his Spidery powers."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,136,"Just like Cop Car, amid the key moments of Homecoming is an insightful coming-of-age throughline."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,137,"There's too much to explore with this version of the character in sequels and spin-offs and so on. If they maintain this level of quality and simplicity (or raise it), there should be no problem. [Full review in Spanish]"
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,138,"Here we are again, watching the same thin plot told with great surface power, but little attention given to the great responsibility of keeping an audience surprised."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,139,"It is a film that shows that cohesion of universe, a clear vision for a character, and a whole lot of money can make something of lasting value, and not just an eyesore that fizzles out after a single weekend."

SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,141,"Headlined by a winning performance from Tom Holland as a teenager enduring a truly demanding puberty, Spider-Man: Homecoming downscales the superhero movie."

SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,143,"Spiderman:Homecoming is a throwback to a superhero age Avengers storylines can't access alone anymore. At stake are friends and neighbourhoods, not entire galaxies."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,144,"Spider-Man: Homecoming has the benefit of a brilliant young lead in Tom Holland and a fantastically-layered villain turn by Michael Keaton, but it bears the burden of all the films that came before it and all those yet to come."

SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,146,"Spider-Man: Homecoming is the perfect superhero flick for millennials (or anyone who lives for a really good movie). Like Peter Parker, we're all just trying to figure things out."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,147,"These tweaks are enough to make Jon Watts's film sufficiently different from past Spider-movies; and its tight story, funny jokes and cute characters are enough to make it pretty enjoyable."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,148,"The chorus of advance raves has declared that Watts has hit the sweet spot. I'd call it sweet-and-sour."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,149,"A smart, fresh film, savvy enough to make a John Hughes reference a throwaway gag and not a mission statement."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,150,Spider-Man: Homecoming is neither a full disappointment nor a complete triumph.
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,151,The most faithful version to the comics of the beloved Marvel character with a diverse cast and a tone and vision that move away from the common MCU. [Full review in Spanish]

SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,155,"Zippy, witty and thoroughly enjoyable ..."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,156,"Part superhero movie, part high-school coming-of-age story, it's bouncy, likable and completely devoid of threat."

SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,158,"In most respects, Spider-Man: Homecoming swings and scores."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,159,"See ""Homecoming"" and tell me there's an Avengers character you love more. I don't expect to hear from you because I know I'm right. And I'm right because the magnificent Tom Holland proves I am."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,160,An exercise in diminishment. Feels like like one of the smallest and most inconsequential Marvel films yet.
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,161,"It's Holland's ability to capture the restless adolescent spirit that needs public affirmation, but also wants to hide under a rock, that makes it such a giddy treat. He's a recognizable kid struggling with identity issues -- on an exaggerated scale."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,162,"It plays like a very long TV show and might even remind old-timers of the '50s-era ""Adventures of Superman."" That's the laughable series in which no one ever recognized George Reeves after he showed up as Clark Kent as soon as his alter ego flew away."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,163,The film sparkles best in its small scenes built around normal high school life.
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,164,"It's a nearly complete triumph- and all it took was going back to high school."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,165,"In director Jon Watts' hands, Spider-Man: Homecoming is a true comedy. There may be better Spider-Man movies, but there's never been a funnier one, one that avoids the origin story and poor old Uncle Ben."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,166,"Tom Holland seems to have been born to play the role, infusing the entire film with cheeky teenage energy. And it's also one of the funniest, most complex blockbusters of the year."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,167,"Directed by Jon Watts and concocted by a team of eight writers, Homecoming is a sleekly-wrought blend of high-school rom-com and high-octane blockbuster."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,168,"Lots of comedy, Marvel universe and even Star Wars references, unexpected cameos, surprising plot twists and an uncontainable charisma from Holland will make you enjoy this film. [Full review in Spanish]"
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,169,Perfectly calibrated entertainment.
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,170,"Holland makes breakthrough, and rest of cast is excellent; film not so much. Hey, ho, let's kind of go?"

SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,176,"Spider-Man: Homecoming isn't really a Spider-Man movie. It's a Peter Parker movie, and that turns out to be an incredibly good thing."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,177,What are the odds that a film with six credited screenwriters and a director (Jon Watts) with more Onion content than anything else could recapture the youthful thrill of superhero movies in general and the youthful appeal of Spider-Man in particular?
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,178,"Can the MCU breathe new life into an beaten-down and bloated spider? ... yes, true believers! Tom Holland is Spider-Man... Keaton does for the Vulture what Molina did for Doc Ock - 'nuff said."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,179,"Best Spider-Man ever. Maguire so-so, Garfield too dark. Holland's SM is brash & funny as hell like the original comic. Well done. Most fun I've had in a theater all year."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,180,"Diverse, entertaining reboot has some language, violence."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,181,This refreshing new spin on the Spider-Man legend is fun and lighthearted with a few thrills along the way.
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,182,"It's taken six tries, but Marvel has finally nailed the spirit of its most iconic character on the silver screen."

SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,189,"Director Jon Watts' film is a fun and exciting action piece, perfect for the summer season, and it turns up its heat right when you think it's going to run out of gas."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,190,Watts effortlessly juggles classroom comedy with larger than life derring-do. Having Keaton for a villain really helps because his manic energy can be amusing and threatening -- depending on the context.
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,191,"Spider-Man: Homecoming is a fine, fun continuation of the MCU content factory."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,192,"Holland probably has five more years in which to dazzle us, and it'll be a crime if Batalon and Zendaya aren't by his side. This franchise is now all about Peter and his friends. Here's looking at you, kids."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,193,For all the CGI-jinks (well up to standard) this is as much a high-school movie as classic superhero stuff.
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,194,"The notion of an immature, untrained Spider-Man brings a fresh feel and the always reliable Michael Keaton makes a sinister but strangely sympathetic villain as The Vulture."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,195,"This one is the best Spider-Man movie ever, and among the best of any in the history of superhero films."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,196,"It's taken six films and three iterations of the character, but Spider-Man: Homecoming is finally the comic version Spider-Man come to the big screen."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,197,"A superhero movie viewers will want to spend more time with, but not because it's a superhero movie."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,198,"Seamless and often stunning visual effects, fast-paced action, smooth writing, nods to the political churn in America, and an easily identifiable and charming hero."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,199,"For long stretches, ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" is an above-average young-adult movie with some super powers thrown in."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,200,Watts and his five other screenwriters are better at the small stuff - the jaunty high school scenes - than the kapowie CGI battle sequences.
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,201,"The powers that be got it right this time as this is a thoroughly entertaining offering. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Profanity, etc. - also Available)"
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,202,"Thoroughly charming. Spider-Man's signature light comedy works surprisingly well even as this story is uniquely steeped in the darker Marvel Cinematic Universe."

SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,209,"An affable, jovial, lighthearted and very funny comedy coming of age that focuses on the psychological and moral growth of a teenager eager for risky and dangerous missions."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,210,"Holland is immensely appealing, young but already very much a hero. My spidey-sense tells me he's just right for the job."

SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,218,"It's fun. John Watts' film carries an innocence and wide-eyed brashness befitting its central character's coming-of-age journey. But it's also capable of surprising."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,219,Packed with heart-pounding action and heartfelt emotion in equal measure.
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,220,"Funny without being tongue-in-cheek and epic without being ponderous, Spider-Man: Homecoming is what a summer movie should be."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,221,Aunt May seems to have discovered the Fountain of Youth. Rosemary Harris was 75 and Sally Field was 66. Marisa Tomei is 53. Aunt May will soon be younger than her nephew.
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,222,"The movie's not flawless, but it is fun, a big improvement on the non-wowing The Amazing Spider-Man and its sequel of recent years."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,223,Deviously original ...
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,224,Amazing? Yes. Spectacular? Most certainly. Superior? Without a shadow of a doubt.
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,225,"It's funny, and a couple of the big action sequences have tension as well as spectacle ..."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,226,"After a decade and a half and five feature films of wildly varying quality, here is a Spider-Man movie that shows the pure heart of its excitable young hero."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,227,"With its sunny warmth and its hilarious script by Watts and five other writers, Spider-Man: Homecoming is breezy fun, one of the most enjoyable superhero epics yet."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,228,"Another good-enough Marvel movie that is less than the sum of its parts, a crowd-pleaser with many fine scenes but no great ones."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,229,The best personification of the character on the big screen. [Full review in Spanish]
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,230,"No cobwebs on Spidey - Spider-Man: Homecoming feels breezily, pleasingly fresh."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,231,"It is, like they promised, a quintessential American coming-of-age movie John Hughes would've been proud of, complete with jocks and nerds, bored teachers and detention, after-school hijinks, and first love."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,232,"Spider-Man: Homecoming benefits from its small scale and its focus on Peter's day-to-day teenage existence. The Marvel movies could use more of this."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,233,"A summer film that re-creates in a surprisingly entertaining way the myth of a hero in the era of technology, and that all it seeks is to connect with a young audience eager to skip school and go to the movies. [Full review in Spanish]"
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,234,"Exhilarating, hilarious, fast-paced, and grounded in reality. It's the funniest chapter yet in the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,235,"one can't deny that all involved have delivered exactly the movie that hardcore fans wanted"
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,236,"Considering that it's the sixth Spider-Man movie in 15 years, and that it features the third actor in the title role, it's amazing that it's as distinctive and enjoyable as it is. You might even say that it's a marvel."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,237,"(Tom) Holland deftly wears Parker's uncertainties and insecurities - not only about his responsibilities as Spider-Man, but also about the hazards of navigating the shark-infested waters of high school."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,238,"By making Spider-Man younger than before, Homecoming smartly sidesteps direct comparisons with the previous incarnations of the superhero."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,239,"Darned if Holland's Spidey doesn't breathe new life into the old webslinger, who officially turns 55 this year and doesn't look a day over 15 in the movie. How'd they do it?"
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,240,"""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" is breezy fun."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,241,"Tom Holland's Peter Parker, one of the liveliest characters in last year's Captain America: Civil War, now has an entire movie devoted to him - one with plenty of youthful snap and crackle."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,242,"By all means put out the welcome mat for this Homecoming, but just don't expect too many vivid memories of the visit."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,243,"The screen is a Fourth of July for firework special effects and pyrotechnic slug-outs by land, sky and sea. Take the kids; take the family; take yourself."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,244,"Marvel's heartfelt and wonderfully down to Earth approach to Spider-Man is a winner."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,245,"It's a summer blockbuster worthy of the moniker."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,246,"Director Jon Watts and a mostly familiar cast have managed to put a fresh face on the franchise, one that's entertaining to boot."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,247,"An authentic, refreshingly nerdy and high-spirited reboot of the well-worn Marvel franchise ..."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,248,"In Holland, the silver screen has its youngest and best Spider-Man yet. He's juvenile, irresponsible and amateur. He's a kid. And you feel for him, since we've all experienced the social pressures of school."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,249,"The filmic equivalent of mum's lasagne - it's comforting, tasty, nothing special, but exactly what you're looking for."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,250,Holland plays a 15-year-old Peter Parker with such joyous naiveté and youthful exuberance that his predecessors -- the nerdy Tobey Maguire and the neatly coifed Andrew Garfield -- now seem more like grad students than high schoolers.
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,251,"For the first time, the most popular of all of Marvel's 1960s-era characters genuinely focuses less on the amazing and more on the boy behind the mask, and that's a welcome change of pace."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,252,"The costumed antics of Homecoming are a joy to watch, with tense set pieces and well-choreographed action, but some of the movie's brightest spots are in its more down-to-earth moments."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,253,"Ultimately, ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" manages to be surprising, uplifting and heroic - all without letting our hero emerge too triumphant."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,254,"Within seconds of meeting these characters, I got past the feeling that another Spider-Man seemed premature. Heck, when a superhero is as much fun as the one in ""Homecoming,"" he's always welcome."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,255,"Most of Homecoming proceeds according to reliable Marvel formula, with solid but generic direction from Jon Watts."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,256,"Holland was born to play this part, with just the right mixture of seriousness and silliness without ever being corny or cliche."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,257,"Spider-Man: Homecoming does the improbable, successfully rebooting a reboot of a trilogy that did the job well enough only a decade ago. It's a movie that could be unnecessary but isn't."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,258,"Just as the character's primary goal here is about proving himself, in terms of Marvel injecting a rejuvenating vitality into its wayward wall-crawler, ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" clears that bar and then some."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,259,A smart and entertaining reboot of the Spider-Man franchise is young at heart and in execution. This could be the first true coming of age comic book movie that adults will like just as much as their kids.
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,260,"Against considerable odds, ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" finds its pace and rhythm by the end."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,261,A Spider-Man movie trapped in an Iron Man movie.
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,262,"It delivers eye-popping spectacle in spades, but it's the characters that make it count."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,263,"A mixed bag: it's nice to have Spider-Man rebooted with an actor so right for the part as Holland, but the effort to integrate him into the wider Marvel Universe raises doubts the movie doesn't resolve."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,264,Even those of us who regard the Marvel aesthetic as a plague on world cinema can find much in Spider-Man: Homecoming to be charmed by.
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,265,"Beginning with a score that riffs on the late-'70s cartoon and closing with a slyly funny after-credits scene, it's as sure-footed as its arachnid namesake."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,266,"The movie is as bubbly and eager as Peter himself, but a little more efficient. It designs its actions sequences around character and story and - a rare thing in comic-book blockbusters - lets the actors act during the climactic action piece."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,267,[T]he perfect Spider-Man movie and one of the best films yet in the MCU. Audiences are going to fall in love with it...
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,268,"The movie lacks inspiration; even the big ""twist"" is more worthy of a suppressed chuckle than a dropped jaw - it's like something pulled out of a bad soap opera."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,269,The fifth-best superhero film so far this year... is still pretty darn good.
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,270,"Adolescent in all the right ways: limber, reckless, full of youthful brio and uncertainty."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,271,"The movie breaks no new ground, and action sequences that were intended to be thrilling - such as an epic battle on the Staten Island Ferry - just sit there on the screen, incapable of stirring a single pulse, but content in their competence."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,272,"The movie delivers all of the expected action beats, but what it does better than perhaps any of the previous Spider-Man films is capture the humor and sense of fun from the comics."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,273,"What Spider-Man: Homecoming lacks in depth, it more than makes up for with a pop sensibility that fizzes with verve and fun."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,274,"A rollicking, soaring glide of a ride that puts a bright new, fun, feisty, re-energized spin on pop culture's top web star."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,275,"It's a fun ride, but it seemed like the Director loved Peter Parker more than Spider-Man. The more I think about it, the more the movie bugs me."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,276,"Borrowing heavily from John Hughes movies, the witty script ensures that the film succeeds as both high school movie and superhero adventure."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,277,It may have taken 15 years and 3 reboots but Spidey finally has a decent villain.
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,278,Among the many virtues of this delightful film is an acknowledgement that these superhero things are essentially for children.
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,279,"Spider-Man: Homecoming never reaches greatness, but it aces goodness."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,280,This Spidey gets the job done.
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,281,"This third time's the charm in Marvel's pantheon of Spider-Man portrayers. Tobey Maguire was pretty good, Andrew Garfield was so-so, but Holland ... Well, when you've got it, you've got it."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,282,A comprehensively crowd-pleasing success.
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,283,"Holland, like his character, is clearly having a blast throughout, and you'll know just how he feels."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,284,"While working inside the rigid confines of the Marvel blueprint, it manages to work equally well as a superhero movie and a teen comedy."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,285,"For sheer fun, Spider-Man: Homecoming is hard to beat."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,286,"Stark tells Peter to be the friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man and that's exactly what Jon Watts has given us - a grounded hero who has to live in our world. All other superhero directors should take note."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,287,"Cute, nothing more."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,288,"Spider-Man: Homecoming reaches its most impressive heights when the training wheels are off and Stark isn't around."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,289,"I can't think of a movie from the prolific Marvel Cinematic Universe that I have enjoyed more."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,290,"For a film with six screenwriters, Homecoming creates a remarkably coherent vision of a smart kid still dumb about the world, battling the learning curves of his double lives."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,291,"This isn't the same old story of how Peter Parker becomes Spider-Man but rather the story of Spider-Man learning how to be Peter Parker."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,292,"Against the odds, Homecoming breathes new life into the character."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,293,"As long as the kids stay in the picture -- thankfully, that's most of the movie -- Spider-Man: Homecoming is the fun playdate most of us have been looking forward to since the character stole Cap's shield last spring in Captain America: Civil War."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,294,"The less you know about the plot the more the fun, suffice to say that Homecoming trades adolescent angst for hit-the-spot humour (top work from co-stars Jacob Batalon and Zendaya) and throws in some surprises 'twixt webs and wisecracks."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,295,The movie has heart and an ebullience that is infectious.
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,296,"The movie is a soaring, fearless teenage dream. And it feels so great to be able to say: Welcome home, Spidey."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,297,"It's a relief to see a superhero engaged in deeply human activities, like getting ready for a date... This Spider-Man is still just a kid, after all, and he has no energy for existential angst -- just dealing with hormones is enough."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,298,"This is a lighthearted lark that functions as both a standalone feature, as well as an endlessly entertaining entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,299,"The less you know about the gags and twists in this film, the better. Go in as blind as you can and just enjoy the ride. You probably won't see a better or more satisfying superhero film all year."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,300,"This Spider-Man film is undoubtedly the funniest Marvel product since Avengers Assemble, and mercifully we don't have to go through another origins plot."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,301,A welcome narrowing of the Marvel mega-verse away from alien invasions and globe-smashing supervillains and back towards something more intimate.
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,302,A little of the new Spider-Man went an exhilaratingly long way in Captain America: Civil War last year. But a lot of him goes almost nowhere in this slack and spiritless solo escapade.
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,303,"An amazing Spider-Man, a spectacular Spider-Man, and yes, the ultimate Spider-Man."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,304,"My new favorite Spider-Man film, my favorite film of the summer, and possibly my favorite film of 2017."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,305,"Mr. Holland looks and sounds more like a teen than the actors who've previously suited up for this series, and he has fine support from a cast that includes Jacob Batalon as Peter's best friend."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,306,"Spider-Man: Homecoming's biggest achievement is that it makes you forget it's the third different Spider-Man - and second reboot - in less than 20 years."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,307,"Spider-Man: Homecoming is fresh, funny and entertaining, but it ultimately works better as a teen flick than it does as a superhero movie."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,308,"It's not only the best Spider-Man movie -- it's one of the best films in Marvel's cinematic universe."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,309,"...works because it's only partly a Spider-Man movie."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,310,"Holland is simply a likable face, a near-perfect blend of awkwardness, uncertainty and charisma exemplified by the simple physical comedy of putting on the Spider-Man costume."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,311,"Director Jon Watts nicely handles the scenes of adolescent banter and awkwardness; if anything, they're more engaging than the action sequences."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,312,"One might be tempted to have a few cynical thoughts about Spider-Man: Homecoming, were it not for the puppyish form of British actor Tom Holland in the red-and-blue superhero onesie."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,313,"The new Spider-Man's solo Marvel debut is a near-perfect mash-up of superhero movie and teen comedy."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,314,"The characters and scenarios are familiar, but this is a loose, cool, funny remix that makes them feel fresh again. Plus, it's mercifully short on life lessons from Aunt May."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,315,"Spidey is finally able to bounce off other familiar faces, and the results are nothing short of a triumph."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,316,Spider-Man: Homecoming is both a homecoming for the character as well as a movie in which Spider-Man literally goes to homecoming-a fitting re-introduction and an endearingly goofy teen flick.
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,317,The first Spidey flick as ebullient as the comics you read when you were a kid.
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,318,"Spider-Man: Homecoming is a funny, heartfelt, coming of age story that defly captures the awkwardness of being a teenager."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,319,"Peter Parker aka Spider-Man aka the wise-crackin', science-tinkerin', shy-around-girls neighborhood crime-fighter is back. Not just back-home."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,320,"Sony, who had something to gain from allowing Spider-Man to be part of the MCU Universe, just allowed Marvel to make their superstar into a supporting player."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,321,"What's particularly nice about this movie is what it doesn't have: too many bad guys, an overly complicated plot and a bunch of ridiculous fight scenes that are so needlessly complex you can't tell what's happening in them."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,322,"A spry, lovable Spider-Man movie about a spry, lovable Spider-Man."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,323,"Every time Peter has to choose whether to do his self-appointed job or seize one irreplaceable personal moment with Liz, the strain shows on his face. Civil War made his conflicts big, funny, and thrilling. Homecoming makes them personal."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,324,Spider-Man: Homecoming is better than Spider-Man 3 but not by much.
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,325,"Holland is incredibly charming, and embodies Spidey's traditional fondness for wisecracks while not seeming smug. The jokes fly fast, but everything hangs together tonally."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,326,"It's pure exhilaration to watch this new, pitch-perfect version of the iconic hero swing high above the New York City streets, and if the movie's forthcoming sequels are as fun as this, Marvel Studios can keep 'em coming."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,327,"Jon Watts' Spider-Man: Homecoming may be the most sheer fun audiences have ever had with the character."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,328,"Homecoming's sweet-natured hero and its ragtag group of cheery kids project a radiant optimism."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,329,"By far the most lightweight and thematically inconsequential of any and all past ""Spider-Man"" features."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,330,"This is a de-facto origin story, one that makes us wait for the sequel for a Spider-Man who isn't a menace to society."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,331,"An action-packed, beat-the-heat distraction...Lands close enough to the summer-movie sweet spot that the quibbles feel a bit churlish."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,332,Spider-Man: Homecoming is a soaring superhero adventure and is easily the best Spider-Man movie of them all.
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,333,That the movie comes off as loose and sweet and light on its feet as it does feels like sort of minor Marvel miracle.
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,334,"Spider-Man: Homecoming is not your typical Marvel movie -- and that's exactly what makes it great."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,335,"It's the best homecoming imaginable."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,336,Spider-Man: Homecoming works as both a (very) funny high school comedy/drama and strong standalone superhero movie set in the MCU.
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,337,"It's a near-miracle that six screenwriters were able to pool their talents and craft such a winsome, witty story."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,338,"Director Jon Watts gives the iconic web-slinging character a heartfelt story, in what is easily the best written film of the Marvel MCU (::gasp:: villain included) yet."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,339,"The sixth Spider-Man movie in 15 years proves to be a fun, likable coming-of-age tale, albeit one weighed down by its air of familiarity and need to adhere to the overarching narrative of the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,340,News Flash: Tom Holland is the best movie Spider-Man ever. He finds the kid inside the famous red onesie and brings out the kid in even the most hardened filmgoer.
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,341,"Watts nails the timeless cornerstones of adolescence: the crippling anxiety mixed with brash confidence, the life-or-death dimensions of a crush, the impatience to grow up."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,342,"By thoughtfully considering how a modern Spider-Man would fit into the character-driven realm of the MCU, Watts not only created a superhero movie full of charm and surprises, but also one the best MCU movies yet."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,343,"One of the very best Marvel Cinematic Universe films, and one of the best films of the year."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,344,"The magic of Homecoming is that it belongs more to the John Hughes cinematic universe than the Avengers'."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,345,Spider-Man: Homecoming gets it right. It is my favorite Marvel Cinematic Universe movie.
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,346,"A funny, sunny superhero movie for the whole family."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,347,"It's a solid ""Spider-Man"" adventure. And nearly every scene in ""Homecoming"" is filled with bits that rewards fans who play close attention to the details."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,348,"Most impressive is that it's a blast to watch, harkening back to the sugar rush that accompanied flipping through Stan Lee and Steve Ditko's earliest comic adventures ."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,349,"Homecoming takes Peter Parker in a fresh direction not only by investing in his teenage world rather than using it as a backdrop, but by letting him run towards being Spider-Man rather than wrestle with the weight of his responsibilities."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,350,"You know what? Superhero cynicism aside, ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" is really fun."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,351,"On paper, it's among the most inessential blockbusters of the year, but Spider-Man: Homecoming proves that going back to square one and adding good-hearted altruism can go a long way."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,352,"Spider-Man: Homecoming is so joyously entertaining that it's enough to temporarily cure any superhero fatigue. There's wit, smarts and a nifty, inventive plot that serves as a reminder of what buoyant fun such films can bring."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,353,"It may not quite reach the heights of Raimi's Spider-Man 2, but Spider-Man: Homecoming emerges as one of the character's strongest films to date, granting him a clean slate and infinite room to grow."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,354,"Tom Holland's Spidey can't swing back onto screens again fast enough."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,355,"Spider-Man: Training Wheels is entertaining, but still owes too much to Tony Stark."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,356,"Hang in there, True Believers: Maybe it'll get better the second time around."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,357,"Spider-Man: Homecoming is smart, incredibly funny and surprisingly clever. It is an entirely unexpected - perhaps even vanishingly implausible - fresh start for the third Spider-Man franchise of the past fifteen years."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,358,"After 13 long years, we have ourselves another great Spider-Man movie."
SpidermanHomecoming,SpidermanHomecoming_rm,359,A return to form with an incredibly likable cast.
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,0,"Based on the screening I attended, I can attest that audiences seemed to genuinely enjoy the jokes and get swept up in the action sequences."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,1,"To say that the movie loses the plot would not be strictly accurate, for that would imply that there was a plot to lose."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,2,"If I have not yet convinced you of the movie's astonishingly slipshod quality, I'm unlikely ever to do so."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,3,"Writer-director David Ayer doesn't have the right graphic technique for a comic-book-style jamboree -- he's strictly a noirish-pulp guy -- and the characters, all of whom are promisingly introduced, fizzle fast."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,4,"Regrettably, the film's place-setting opening lays the scene for a different, more exciting film that never really unfolds."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,5,"Sometimes it's good to be bad. In Suicide Squad's case, bad is just plain bad. It gives villainy a bad name."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,6,Suicide Squad had such potential but a lazy plot with holes the size of basketballs ruined all of that. Great actors were put to waste in this movie that made no sense.
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,7,"When this movie is bad, it is really, really bad."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,8,A definite skip.
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,9,"Ultimately, a weak villain and flimsy stakes hinder the best efforts of a talented cast, who sadly can't save the film from itself."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,10,"This garish and uneven offering has moments of excellence, but they're not enough to overcome the film's thin narrative, character thinness and general inconsistency."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,11,Suicide Squad is the perfect example of when a filmmaker tries to imitate rather than innovate. [Full Review in Spanish]
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,12,This could have been a great film.
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,13,"It's overstuffed with a rather conventional villain and story, yet it also manages to build up enough good will thanks to three standout performances."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,14,"But is it fun? Well, if you can ignore the blatant stereotypes and ham-fisted dialogue, perhaps. Also if you can ignore the film's dismal view of women. And its soundtrack."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,15,"This film felt like tiny stories all thrown together at once with no real character or plot development. By the time you truly understand the purpose of the villain's existence, you are already in the final act..."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,16,"Woefully sketchy and missing the fueled opulence that one would expect emerging from this cockeyed costume caper, 'Suicide Squad' is a detonating dud for the missing explosive DC Comics movie brand"
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,17,"[Feels] all at once like an irritating wallow in the paint-huffing waste-of-skin teenage version of anarchic excess and the infuriatingly fake, phony, mass-market corporate co-opting of the paint-huffing waste-of-skin teenage version of anarchic excess."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,18,"Suicide Squad plays like a graphic novel brought to life. It's a fun action romp with some great turns from a bunch of actors who are clearly having a blast."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,19,"Suicide Squad is a movie without a plot, operating solely through countless flashbacks that employ some of the most obvious and moronic needle drops in the recent history of blockbuster cinema."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,20,"Much like the antiheroes at its center, it often feels like a conflicted, unfocused mass of energy and attitude that should be far more exciting than it is."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,21,"David Ayer has made his mark on the DC extended universe in a similar way to what Tim Miller did with 'Deadpool' although DC have held back from going all out with this film and kept a 15 rating"
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,22,"Fails to provide enough action and story that doesn't shy itself away from falling to the tropes of a generic summer blockbuster."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,23,"That visual murk, and the film's trafficking with demons...suggests a second-tier Hong Kong fantasy film from the '90s. Like one of those movies, it doesn't much matter if it doesn't make sense."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,24,"At its worst, the film wallows around in dark tones and an endless stream of bullets, making it instead resemble Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, for all the wrong reasons."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,25,"Something's off here. It doesn't feel like the editor and the director were on the same page at all...entirely too much exposition and not enough of the story."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,26,"For all its posturing as a dark portrait of super sociopaths, Suicide Squad.. never becomes nightmarish enough. It lacks the necessary teeth and ambiguity to connect cartoonish evil with the relatable horrors of everyday life."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,27,"""Suicide Squad"" has some fun and worthwhile moments, such as the entire segment of the team's introduction, but it's unclear what it ultimately wants to be and too uneven to make up for it."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,28,"""Suicide Squad"" is full of action, lots of violence and larger-than-life evil thanks to Computer Generated Imagery and costuming. It's dark and menacing and will please fans of this genre."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,29,"In essence, Suicide Squad has everything a summer blockbuster should, without taking itself too seriously. It is the very essence of wildly entertaining."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,30,"I actually didn't hate it. Really."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,31,... the storytelling was done really well and the introduction of the characters was very fun and... the way they handled introducing these characters was handled well.
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,32,"Snap out of it! Wake up and smell the java. ""Suicide Squad"" is a wash. Deal with it. Don't blame the critics who point out, accurately, the film's myriad shortcomings Blame studio meddling for the neutered nature of much of what's unfolding onscreen."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,33,"All in all, this movie was ok. It's not the end of all movies as we know it, and it's not the movie that pierces the heavens either."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,34,"The studio crammed it into a ""summer blockbuster"" suit that didn't fit. There's still an entertaining movie in there, and you'll never be bored. But Suicide Squad isn't going to be the hit that fixes DC's problems."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,35,"I'd say it's so bad it's good, except that I frequently was bored by it."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,36,"There's so much good stuff that I liked in Suicide Squad it's a bummer that it gets so messed up by the bad stuff in there. There's enough good stuff in it that you'll enjoy it, just be prepared that after a while."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,37,"Truly, it's hard to care that much about these bad people, or the lightning-belching cloud of debris swirling above Midway, or whether Jared Leto's Joker is disturbing or distracting."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,38,"If DC keeps moving in this direction, they'll get it right. They figured out a great balance between humor and emotion and seriousness and character development; the pieces were all there."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,39,"Suicide Squad isn't as fun of a ride as Guardians of the Galaxy. It could have been, with more performances like Jared Leto's and Margot Robbie's...."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,40,"Suicide Squad simply shouldn't be a movie about saving the world like every other superhero movie; the characters are far too interesting and entertaining to be stuck in something so cliché"
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,41,"hile it's not perfect, Suicide Squad is very good and definitely worth catching... It's a film with confidence and swagger, a film in which the sharpness of its dialogue is matched only by the coolness of its (very loud) soundtrack."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,42,"Suicide Squad shows all the signs of a movie subjected to heavy studio interference-terrible pacing, horrendous editing, uneven tone."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,43,"Somewhere in that mess is a film, possibly a good one. As presented, however, Suicide Squad is a wasted opportunity."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,44,"Suicide Squad leans hard on The Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy as templates, but while Marvel's movies generally zip along, Suicide Squad lurches."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,45,"A ragtag assortment of ethnicities, genders and crossbreeds, ""Suicide Squad"" is not an ode to violence but to the ordered perception we create to rationalize our lust for it, onscreen or otherwise."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,46,"For all its cast and crew's inglorious chest-thumping, Suicide Squad is a failed, forced exercise in - of all things! you had one job! - ensemble chemistry."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,47,"The film fails its characters by not leaving room for them to stand out individually, and it fails women by attempting to sell an overtly abusive relationship as romantic."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,48,"It's far from perfect. But the characters are lovable, the world they live in is intriguingly weird, and all in all Suicide Squad offers a playful alternative to DC's more straightforward superhero films."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,49,"It is by no means good, and yet I can't bring myself to hate it."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,50,"Suicide Squad is a movie that is something of a mess but that jumble, for me, worked in its favor in as many ways as it worked as a negative."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,51,"The imagery is just as dark as the premise-the city is a ruined war zone enveloped in night-but otherwise it's another CGI spectacle of big battle set-pieces, epic destruction, and high body count, with the least imaginative jukebox score ever..."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,52,"Seeing this film was finding moments of incredible happiness nuanced, quickly, by a boring sadness. [Full review in Spanish]"
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,53,"The good news is, it's better than BvS. The bad news is, that's about the best that can be said about it."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,54,"Since I'm no avid superhero fan, I hate to choose sides. However, it is clear that what Marvel does consistently is the very thing that DC Comics continues to struggle with."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,55,"The standout performances belong to Will Smith, who gets the balance between a dreaded killer and a caring father just right. Margot Robbie too is a hoot as Harley Quinn."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,56,"Don't miss this one. And stay for the end credits."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,57,A jukebox of a superhero movie.
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,58,"The action is a been-there-done-that yawn, the obligatory wisecracks fall flat, and the CGI work looks like outtakes from Ghostbusters. The original."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,59,"It's more entertaining than Batman v Superman, the first film in the new DC Comics franchise, but compared with Guardians Of The Galaxy, Marvel's offbeat ensemble, it's anything but super."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,60,"Man, DC Comics movies, I am rooting for you, but you are not making it easy."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,61,"The sight of Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn dolled up in her sexy anime-inspired outfit offers a mildly pleasing distraction, but the so-so action, with all the requisite explosions and muzzle flash, is very same-same."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,62,"...thematically, the entire film is about the conflict between love and loyalty/duty."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,63,"[Robbie] is by far the top attraction in Suicide Squad, an otherwise tragically ill-conceived juggernaut from the people who make Superman and Batman."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,64,I am happy to report that Suicide Squad is a significant improvement over its lumpen predecessor.
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,65,"With its overcrowded cast of characters, bland and underdeveloped villains, and monotonous action sequences, David Ayer's Suicide Squad becomes one of the biggest disappointments of the year and another major letdown for fans of DC Comics."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,66,"In short, Suicide Squad Extended Cut is fun, packed with personality and, thankfully, features more of Harley Quinn. Just be aware that what you'll see won't greatly differ from what was presented in theatres."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,67,"The stuff that happens is altogether messy in its assemblage, but at least Ayer makes certain to keep it speeding at us quickly."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,68,"All it does is basically slap on a couple of deleted scenes willy-nilly (most of which feature Leto, possibly to stop him from going around town and blabbing to whoever will listen about how all of his scenes were chopped out)."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,69,"This Squad is just another example of DC/Warner Bros. arriving late to their own party, and forgetting to bring the wine."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,70,This is a wasted opportunity on so many levels.
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,71,A rather aggressively unwatchable comic-book adaptation...
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,72,"DC's pretty much been about Dark Clouds, Dismal Conditions, and Dire Consequences so far. And so it continues in anti-hero flick Suicide Squad, except for the welcome, bright-eyed relief of an anti-romance between two Deranged Characters."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,73,"In Guardians and Avengers both, when the team finally comes together, it's big. Cinematic. Triumphant. That same moment in Suicide Squad feels more like the Ben Stiller-led Mystery Men."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,74,"Writer/director David Ayer reportedly penned the script in six weeks, which is painfully obvious from the horrible dialogue, weak characterization, and threadbare plot."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,75,Suicide Squad is an absolute waste of time. [Full review in Spanish]
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,76,"Needs three more re-writes, more depth to at least two out of the dozen characters at play here, more of a reason to give a rip, and about 15 more minutes of the Joker."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,77,"An over-caffeinated, underwhelming succession of skirmishes and squabbles with plot borrowed from X-Men: Apocalypse and lessons not learned from Batman and Robin."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,78,"As a lifelong enthusiast of cinematic delirium, I groan at the very thought of Suicide Squad."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,79,"It's a shame the movie amounts to so little because there are some great performances."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,80,"Jared Leto's tatted-up, bling-brandishing Clown Prince of Crime is more Juggalo than Joker."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,81,"One of this year's biggest disappointments. Worst than Batman vs Superman. [Full review in Spanish]"
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,82,"Nothing more than a film dedicated to Batman and Superman's enemies in which they compare their abilities to see who's the best (or worst) of all. [Full review in Spanish]"
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,83,"Beyond the interesting aesthetic, [Suicide Squad] doesn't really have much going for it."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,84,"begins with such promise-full of such boisterous, unruly energy and mash-up devil-may-care style-that its eventual descent into the doldrums of formulaic familiarity feels that much more disappointing"
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,85,"As always, The Joker stands apart. And that's what makes him so fascinating."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,86,"Conventional logic is typically turned on its head in comic book adaptations, but Suicide Squad is even more lazily plotted than the average saviours-in-tights saga."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,87,"'Suicide Squad' doesn't quite go all the way, and it's even below Zack Snyder's recent work. [Full review in Spanish]"
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,88,Much better than Batman v Superman. [Full review in Spanish]
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,89,"Generic and poorly executed. You can't help feel sorry for the filmmakers. [Full review in Spanish]"
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,90,The film has enough action and elements to make it very entertaining. [Full review in Spanish]
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,91,"It succeeds more than it fails. It's certainly entertaining and Smith is better than he has been in years with Robbie a star in the making, but the structural problems are almost fatal."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,92,Suicide Squat.
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,93,"A cult film if ever there was one, or should that be cult of personality, chock full of risks and unpredictability."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,94,Ayer probably squeezes the most disreputable fun into this PG-13 film as he was allowed.
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,95,"For me I'd just be happy to follow Ms. Quinn for a day at the mall. Cyndi Lauper's ""Girls Just Want to have Fun"" would be the anthem. Leave the Joker at home. Ah, missed opportunities."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,96,"Even after years in development hell, Suicide Squad feels half-hearted and unfinished -- like a comic book sketch that hasn't been inked or colored."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,97,"Think metaphorically again, and see that Suicide Squad entangles post-Vietnam and post-9/11 notions about heroism and citizenship...Suicide Squad is The Dirty Dozen for millennial viewers (and voters), who think their patriotic moral conflict is new."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,98,"A sex bomb liable to explode in your face at any moment, [Margot Robbie's] firecracker character is the best thing about the film."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,99,"'Suicide Squad' is nothing to Marvel at."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,100,"Knee deep in spent shell casings and sardonic asides, David Ayer's superhero-friendly remake of The Dirty Dozen becomes more conventional as it unfolds."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,101,"Suicide Squad is ... disorganized, colorful trash slathered in embossed fonts and spray paint ... missed opportunities, whiffed almost-jokes, and half-baked ideas."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,102,Add Suicide Squad to the growing list of summer 2016 disappointments.
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,103,"'Suicide Squad' is a rowdy, rambunctious, entertaining flick that strikes the perfect, slightly-darker tone the DC movies have been grasping for to set them apart from Marvel."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,104,Just unpleasant from beginning to end.
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,105,"Thanks to some interesting characters and some Deadpool-inspired gallows humor, this is a fun film to watch, but not as much fun as it should have been. It has problems, but it does manage to rise a bit above the usual Hollywood mediocrity."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,106,"Even with the suspension of disbelief, nothing in the movie makes sense. [Full review in Spanish]"
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,107,"It's disappointing to see all that potential wasted. [Full review in Spanish]"
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,108,"It's not a bad movie, but that doesn't mean it's good either. [Full review in Spanish]"
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,109,"A bad movie, lazy, the product of cashing in instead of making a good film. [Full review in Spanish]"
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,110,Lighthearted and entertaining without losing the essence of DC Comics. [Full review in Spanish]
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,111,"The film lives or dies on Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn, and that's a problem, because Ayer doesn't know what to do with her -- or any of his female cast."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,112,"Fine, but really ought to have been better."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,113,"How many superhero comic-book movies does it take to make you yawn with boredom? If you haven't reached your saturation point, this could push you over the edge as super-heroes are replaced by super-villains..."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,114,"As the film's standout, Robbie plays Harley with gusto. Give her a spin off, please."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,115,"Embraces virtually all of the clichés of the modern-day superhero genre, and all the pitfalls specific to DC's movies- wasn't it supposed to look cool, at least? (Splice Today)"
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,116,"Despite some major flaws, this film still packs a punch thanks to the performances of Will Smith and Margot Robbie and a few solid action scenes."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,117,"Suicide Squad had the potential to be an awesome superhero summer blockbuster, but feels more like a rushed unification of underwhelming action, a disappointing story, and stale character development."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,118,"Taken from a popular DC comic series... helmed by a star quality director... peppered with a highly skilled, all-star cast ... What could go wrong? Nearly everything."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,119,"Leto's doing his very best Heath Ledger (when he's doing anything at all), but his work has none of Ledger's dysfunction, dread, or menace; he's about as scary as a fifth-grader making faces at himself in a Hot Topic changing room mirror."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,120,"Everything is flat & grim, there's hardly no color in this depressing world at all. Anytime the brightest thing is Harley Quinn a psychotic killer & all round annoying character, something is seriously wrong. Actors & audiences deserve better."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,121,"I understand the appeal of setting up characters that we'll eventually see again, but can we at least have a good story to start them off with a bang?"
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,122,"Has its flaws, but still manages to entertain."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,123,Call DC Comics the Donald Trump of blockbusters.
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,124,"It's not a bad idea but the film is just another overblown, overstuffed epic, top heavy with special-effects and made even more chaotic by the abundance of largely unfamiliar characters."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,125,"What could be more fun than watching bad people do bad things in the service of good? Unfortunately, even a film full of villains needs a credible antagonist, and this is one of the many problems with Suicide Squad."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,126,"Shocked by the fun I had with this film. The next one should just be called ""Harley Quinn"" cause Margot Robbie makes the movie."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,127,"A bona fide comic book hang out movie [wherein the characters lend] any given five-minute stretch five times the personality of the entirety of ""Batman V Superman."""
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,128,"It's a curious and perhaps unprecedented one act movie, bookended by an introduction and epilogue."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,129,"Leto opts for ""Insane Clown Pimp,"" with the results being about as enjoyable as you'd expect from anything with the initials ""ICP."""
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,130,"At least the soundtrack is good, with such gems as ""Sympathy for the Devil,"" ""Fortunate Son"" and ""Without Me."" But it makes sense that no one thought to include Ozzy Osbourne's ""Suicide Solution,"" since Suicide Squad isn't the answer to anyone's prayers."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,131,"A vapid, soulless, tedious and painfully boring blockbuster. A contender for one of the worst films of the year. I'm surprised it wasn't directed by Alan Smithee."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,132,"These supervillains are tiringly two-dimensional, with their back stories played out like cut scenes from a video game."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,133,"I'm no Marvel acolyte keen to dump on the DC movie universe, but, with a heavy heart, this wobbly walk on the wild side is not going to challenge Marvel's way with a comic-book blockbuster."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,134,"time is pulled like taffy at the edge of a black hole, which is a fine comparison to this flick, where explosions and CGI, helicopter crashes are trapped with no hope of escape into a story that might make them worth seeing"
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,135,"Where Suicide Squad's Big Bad should be there is only a Big Narrative Hole."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,136,Suicide Squad is fine summer entertainment and the closest DC has come so far to keeping up with Marvel.
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,137,"Overall, though, the final two-thirds of the film are less funny than should be the case. The villains versus villains confrontation is not well explained and the fight scenes are unspectacular."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,138,"Even a great idea and a wonderful cast can't fend off a serious case of the blahs"
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,139,"You're left wondering who you're meant to be rooting for. Of course, it's meant to be the colourful team of recognisable characters, but at this point there's been no effort to have them connect with the audience in some way."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,140,"The plot is unbelievably dumb, but there are some winning performances."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,141,"It starts off so well, but then the heavy hand of corporate DC filmmaking just leaches all the fizz and colour out of it."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,142,"It's a tough thing to balance the requirements of a satisfying action movie while meeting the logistical story demands of a billion-dollar franchise."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,143,"While reports of reshoots and studio interference are as prevalent in blockbuster cinema as superheroes, there's a jarring mash of tones and clumsy editing that suggests that someone felt that something wasn't quite right on Suicide Squad."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,144,punishing rather than entertaining
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,145,"Even Smith's smart-aleck charm comes up short, with Deadshot's lines either not very funny or out of place to what's happening in the film."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,146,"Alas, the result is a surprisingly disjointed mess."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,147,"The muddled tone and obvious post-production tinkering makes it feel more like DC's version of Fantastic Four."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,148,"Most disappointing, though, is that a movie about supervillains forced to do some good is no fun at all."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,149,"While far from perfect, Suicide Squad is a step forward for the DC Cinematic Universe after the utter disaster that was Batman v Superman."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,150,"The good work hinted at in Margot Robbie's depiction of the playfully psychotic Harley Quinn or Jared Leto's Joker (sparingly used to the point of frustration) never get the time to breathe and grow that they clearly deserve."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,151,"Suicide Squad continues with more of a whimper than a bang, lurching from one so-so set piece to another with the occasional token gesture towards character development."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,152,"The B-list superheroes have been unleashed upon the world, with their very own cult B-movie, and it's quite a lot of fun."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,153,"The production values are quite good, and so is the fun, pop music score. But there's a lot of action scenes, and that shortchanges the storyline. It could have also used more doses of humor."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,154,"A lot of quality performances are undercut by a weak story, and Suicide Squad kamikazes its way into a clunky disappointment."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,155,"I'm bad, and that's good. I will never be good, and that's not bad. There's no one I'd rather be than me."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,156,"David Ayer is of the realist school of action filmmaking and this doesn't jibe well with fantastical fights and outrageous cartoon characters."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,157,"Should be grim, bitter, and as horrifyingly alluring as Hannibal Lecter. But it's nothing but a teen-friendly ad for toys, Ts, and other disposable merch."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,158,Revenge has seldom tasted so boring.
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,159,"This movie fits the formula perfectly with a fight every 10 or 15 minutes each of which defies all logic and reason. Nothing's perfect, or I would call this a perfect waste of time. ..if you have seen one of these, you have seen them all."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,160,"In buttfloss rollerskate shorts, and a kinderslut outfit, complete with bubblegum and pigtails, Robbie wobbles between daft child and supposedly irresistible femme fatale."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,161,"Robbie steals the show as the unsheathed force of sex and violence because her character experiences all the horror as entertainment - which is where we are right now... searching for giddy escapism at the end of a gun barrel, rooting for the bad guys"
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,162,"DC's antiheroes disappoint in muddled, violent mess."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,163,Justice League is going to have a tough row to hoe to win over audiences following Batman v Superman and now Suicide Squad.
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,164,"Cluttered with flashbacks and comic book references, Suicide Squad is like... a two-hour trailer for Suicide Squad. Reactions may vary."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,165,The movie never stops underlining how cool their anti-authoritarian attitudes are.
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,166,"[It has]a hardcore, colourful tone that is so much more enjoyable than the epic bleakness of Bats V Supes, but it is still a hardcore, colourful mess"
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,167,"Seriously, ""it wasn't the cast's fault"" should be the epithet on the DC movie universe's tombstone."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,168,"If there is an original idea in its ugly little head, Suicide Squad conceals it better than Batman hides his cave."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,169,"Whatever the revisions were, they turned out to be masterstrokes that boosted the material to fulfill the promise of the trailers."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,170,"It is (perhaps by default) probably the worst ""big"" DC Comics live-action movie since 'Catwoman'."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,171,"Suicide Squad is a lively comic book movie - albeit one that is undermined by plot holes and uneven execution of action, character, and comedy."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,172,"Can't we go back to watching those cool Suicide Squad trailers and ignore this massive disappointment?"
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,173,"It's like looking forward to Christmas all year and then waking up on the big day to find Santa Claus sprawled out dead under your tree."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,174,This is how you end the summer blockbuster season with a yawn.
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,175,"""Suicide Squad"" is more messy than meaningful. It's an adventure that lacks weight."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,176,"While it might be good to be bad, Suicide Squad is just plain awful."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,177,"It's explosive, preposterous, exhilarating and like all the best films based on comic-book characters, doesn't take itself too seriously. Indeed, there are more than a few laugh-out-loud moments."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,178,One of the more refreshingly uncomplicated summer blockbusters in recent memory.
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,179,"Suicide Squad may not be the end of the DC Extended Universe, but it does hurt it, really, really bad"
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,180,"There are some astonishing visuals and enjoyable performances from Will Smith and Margot Robbie in particular, but overall Suicide Squad is a sloppy mess."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,181,Suicide Squad is an exposition dump masquerading as a cinematic experience.
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,182,"For someone who knows the toughness of military life and regularly makes films about how macho and brave law enforcement is, David Ayer's adolescence is staggering. He needs better squad goals."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,183,"The most damning indictment of Suicide Squad is that it's unrelentingly bland."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,184,"A long way from perfect but still a joyously deranged action flick that was great fun to watch, despite some iffy plotting and under-written characters."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,185,Suicide by movie for some soon-to-be A-list actors and for Will Smith who used to be one.
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,186,"In a movie summer of disappointments, 'Suicide Squad' might be the major downer of them all."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,187,"Yet another mediocre entry in DC's cinematic franchise."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,188,Ayer-whose films have heretofore been fiercely moral-seems to want to look away for as long as possible from what this movie is really saying.
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,189,Suicide Squad should have been a whole lot better.
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,190,"The real bad news is the script. While it certainly has its moments (Harley Quinn gets all the best lines), a huge chunk of it is little more than characters threatening one another with insipid one-liners."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,191,"The plotting, which initially seems intriguing, eventually collapses onto its own narrative petard, and the entire affair devolves into a rain-drenched slow-motion climax."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,192,"[Suicide Squad] forgoes interesting characters and engaging plotlines in favor of faux nihilism and flat one-liners. There's simply no reason to care about anything or anyone in this bumbling ballet of idiocy and pyrotechnics."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,193,"Arriving a mere five months after Batman v Superman, a DC Comics epic as vaultingly joylss as a memorial chapel in Valhalla, Suicide Squad at least has some rumbling, crunchy kick -- and, amid a sprawling, grungy cast, a terrific Margot Robbie."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,194,Another day; another comic-book pandemonium.
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,195,Suicide Squad promised transgressive freaky grown-up fun in its trailers. Something that might have rivalled the outlandishness of Deadpool. But the end result is a mild-mannered play-it-safe slog.
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,196,The biggest bummer about Suicide Squad is that its ads promised something different from the other too-many-superheroes-crammed-in-one-movie movies. What it delivers is yet another film overflowing with superheroes we barely get to know.
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,197,Suicide Squad amounts to an all-out attack on the whole idea of entertainment.
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,198,"It wants so desperately to be subversive and irreverent in the manner of Fight Club or, more likely, Deadpool. And yet the most shocking thing about it is how risk-averse it turns out to be."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,199,"Is Suicide Squad the worst superhero flick, ever? Not remotely. It starts with style and laughs before descending into a mud pit of clichés and dull action. Worth seeing for Viola Davis' mighty Amanda Waller as the spinoff I now want most."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,200,"A giant dumpster fire of perplexing plotting, erratic pacing, racial stereotypes and a problematic male gaze."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,201,"I don't know about you but these are my kind of meta-humans."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,202,"There are those that will hate this film beyond reason, and those that will love it beyond fact. The truth lands somewhere in the middle, as we've got something that feels more squandered than anything..."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,203,Some killer performances rise above an anemic and predictable story in this DC Comics antihero film.
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,204,"It lacks that in-your-face presence that dares the audience to embrace it. It's a film that should say take me or leave me, I don't give a damn."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,205,Suicide Squad is a movie that contains moments of legitimate entertainment value that far outweigh any of its shortcomings.
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,206,"The closest Suicide Squad comes to the masterworks of Christopher Nolan is that, like Memento, it suffers from instant amnesia."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,207,"Suicide Squad is the most miserable time I've had at the movies in my life."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,208,"Embrace the bad-guy version of being good, and how visibly uncomfortable that fit is on the members of Suicide Squad, and you'll find some fun."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,209,It has the same problems that made BvS such a big flop. [Full review in Spanish]
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,210,"Whenever Robbie isn't dancing around, the movie feels as heavy and relentless as a Mack truck."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,211,"[S]pends more than half of its running time establishing these characters, only to turn them into personality-deprived pawns when they actually have to do something."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,212,"Even the most garish escapism requires a director who has the mental discipline to hold out for a fecund idea and the inventive power to build on it. In Suicide Squad, as in Sabotage, the only time brains enter the picture is when heads explode."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,213,"This movie dearly hopes it can skate by entirely on attitude, but forgets to develop said attitude. It wants to stand out thanks to its team dynamics, but forgets that a team is made up of many individual characters."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,214,"Suicide Squad is the biggest superhero disappointment in recent memory (even more than Batman v Superman). Not only does it fail to shake things up, but it's not even competent enough to be a serviceable superhero flick."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,215,"Don't think of ""Suicide Squad"" as the villainous flipside to ""X-Men"" ... instead, think Zzzzz-Men."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,216,"[A] strange embrace of a movie, which continues to tantalize even as it overstimulates."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,217,"Not even Margot Robbie's enthusiasm nor Viola Davis nor professional movie star Will Smith can save Suicide Squad, written and directed by David Ayer, from somehow being visually unpleasant, tedious and obnoxious all at once."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,218,"Everything about ""Suicide Squad"" from the title on down promises overkill. And the movie, to its ultimate discredit, delivers."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,219,"There's no one to root for in this movie, and no one whose prospects we care about. Several plot points lack coherence, and inserted flashbacks add to a sense of the film having been fused into shape in the editing room."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,220,"Suicide Squad looked bright and promising in its run-up, but lands on the screen with a big-budget thud of missed opportunities."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,221,"At some point, with Smith and Robbie getting most of the screen time, this team was supposed to jell and form a unit whose members depend on one another. Frankly, they don't."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,222,"Spiritually dead film-making with canned classic-rock accompaniment. Can't wait for more avocado-men to meet their end. Enchantress is terrible villain. Robbie is only source of fun."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,223,"""Suicide Squad"" is an interminable muddle."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,224,"For all that exposition, the film never tells us what we really need to know: Why should we care?"
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,225,"Suicide Squad never tries to be anything more than the cool whip on top of the sundae. It's a kicks and giggles take on the DC universe, vastly more entertaining than Batman v Superman."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,226,"Light on plot but loaded with style, Suicide Squad is all character and charisma but ultimately empty and largely saved by Robbie and Smith."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,227,"There's a lot to like about the basic setup, but it's too often hindered by the film's many flaws and surprising conventionality."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,228,"Not a complete disaster, but inexcusably mediocre. To be fair, the audience I saw the film with appeared to love every frame: big laughter, cheers for the action and clapping as the credits rolled. Is there a disconnect between critics and audiences?"
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,229,"A hot mess--but a loud, star-packed, proudly trashy one."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,230,It was supposed to show us that the folks at Warner Bros. still know how to make great comic book movies. Suicide Squad is not very successful at that.
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,231,"It starts with a bang, ends in a yawn and features a whole lot of ""What the ...?"" along the way."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,232,"In aiming for - but falling short of appealing to - the teenage demographic, the film is a double cop-out, disappointing both fans of the source material's grown-up gloom-and-doom aesthetic and discerning adolescents."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,233,"Sure, it's terrible. But it's not even close to the worst movie of the summer or the year."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,234,"Messy, derivative and nowhere near as cool or edgy as it thinks it is."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,235,Ayer tries to compensate with a distractingly garish visual style and a proliferation of recognizable music cues that set up scenes to be much cooler than they actually are.
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,236,The cheap sentimentality betrays the nature of the characters. [Full review in Portuguese.]
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,237,"Suicide Squad is one long stuttering introduction with fugitive glimpses of the film's potential."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,238,"The casting is spot-on, with Margot Robbie instantly iconic as Harley Quinn, a breakout character that could easily launch a franchise of her own."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,239,"Of the three films thus far, (this) is the most interesting: a nihilistic adventure comedy... succeeds far more than it fails, especially compared to its 2016 theatrical peers."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,240,"An absolute cinematic mess. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Sexual Content, Profanity, etc. - also Available)"
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,241,"The filmmaker and studio's inexplicable decision to construct a building without first laying a foundation was self-evidently a bad one."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,242,"You could put this movie's scenes on shuffle, and it would almost make as much sense."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,243,[A] bloated and cheerless monstrosity.
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,244,"Overall, the movie was a bunch of characters, some of them interesting, trying to make the best of a weak, convoluted plot."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,245,"[Ayer] clearly wants to delve into taboo territory with Suicide Squad, but PG-13 limitations blunt his provocative story into a teasing narrative of pulled punches and cartoony, sanitized violence."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,246,"Even [Robbie's] performance can't counter the painfully slow start, steady flood of trite action scenes and a convoluted story that would have to improve tenfold to be even passable."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,247,"It didn't need to be anything more than another fun and entertaining entry in the DC movie universe. For better or worse for DC fans/haters, that's exactly what it delivers."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,248,"It gives me no pleasure to trash this film. I want D.C. Comics fans to have nice things, too. On the bright side, there are, like, a gajillion more D.C. Comics films coming down the pike. At least one of them has to be good, right? Right?"
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,249,"How about next time, instead of telling us how bad you are, you actually show us?"
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,250,What does writer/director David Ayer do with all this? He gives us extended fight scenes... What he does not do is give us any reason to care about the results.
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,251,"Suicide Squad is likely to be good enough for some, but it's by no measure good. It's a smattering of recognizable faces and costumes in an otherwise incoherent, listless story."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,252,"Ayer tries to bring his trademark realism to the action sequences, but it gets lost in the realm of comic-book fantasy."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,253,"It's massive, messy and noisy. And it stinks."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,254,Suicide Squad is another case where story elements are continuously piled on in the hopes that a coherent narrative arc will emerge.
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,255,"It doesn't take long for the film's incomprehensible ""plot"" to reveal itself to be a mundane excuse for fights and explosions."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,256,"Suicide Squad is a flawed movie, but it does manage to squeeze out more moviegoing pleasure than the stodgy Batman v. Superman did. It opens up the possibility that Warner Bros.' extension of its DC universe won't be a joyless chore."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,257,"The air almost immediately starts leaking out of the film once it starts. The whole first half-hour is a riot of blunt exposition, useless flashbacks, and false starts. This is a movie that doesn't even know how to begin."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,258,"[It was up to Ayer] to revitalize...the DC franchise. He has done just that, with a singular vision, an unbridled passion and a creative vengeance that is so bold and so bad (in a colourfully good way) that it leaves viewers breathless."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,259,"Positioned as a hell-raising alternative to normal comic book fare, ""Suicide Squad"" doesn't maintain the illusion, consuming genre sameness as Ayer takes a punk rock concept and turns it into a bland, mainstream extravaganza."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,260,"""Suicide Squad"" is a concept in search of a story worth telling."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,261,"Wildly tonally inconsistent, not to mention cluttered and poorly paced."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,262,"If awards were handed out for the loudest movie of the year, Suicide Squad would be Schindler's List. But volume is not vision...while containing some entertaining performances, [it] turns out to be just another generic superhero action movie."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,263,"When Delevingne's Enchantress is at her most evil, for example, she does a snake-hips-wavey-arms hula dance out of a 1950s Bob Hope comedy. Ayers shoots this scene with a deadly earnestness. What on earth made him think this could work?"
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,264,"It's the apparent lack of strategy in putting together these pieces that undermines the lot, resulting in a good deal less than the sum of the film's admittedly decent parts."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,265,"Even credible efforts by Smith and especially Margot Robbie -- vamping it up as the apple of the Joker's eye, the sadistic Harley Quinn -- don't breathe life into the film frequently enough to give it much of a pulse."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,266,"Suicide Squad is nothing more than fast and fun entertainment and that's ok, it succeeds at it. [Full review in Spanish]"

SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,270,"David Ayer's film longs to be bad, yet its forced by outside pressures to follow narrow, preset rules."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,271,A perfect choice to have a great time at the movies this summer. [Full review in Spanish]
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,272,The film had a lot more potential and ended up being just entertaining by not taking any risks. [Full review in Spanish]
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,273,A film that had everything to be awesome but ended up being just ok. [Full review in Spanish]
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,274,"The question isn't whether ""Suicide Squad"" is as good as ""The Avengers,"" but whether it's as bad as ""Green Lantern."""
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,275,"'Suicide Squad' is bloated, it leans too heavily on fan-service, and the story looks like it was fed through a wood-chipper"
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,276,"A PG-13 jab at grimy, scuzzy, post-punk, post-Michael Mann, nearly-post-Zack Snyder bubblegum antihero action."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,277,"Suicide Squad does have quite a few tremendously entertaining sequences of high action and low comedy. It's a shame it never rises beyond that."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,278,"Like the misbehaving, problem child in the DC family, the movie doesn't follow rules, nor abide by any formula - but in turn is a challenge to understand, & sadly, one you just want to ignore."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,279,"What it gets right is in letting the bad guys, which is pretty much everybody in this sordid soup of hidden agendas and homicidal tendencies, be bad guys."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,280,"There isn't a moment of spontaneous fun or humor in this long, turgid movie, the latest letdown for DC Comics fans who've been waiting for someone to pick up the baton Christopher Nolan left behind."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,281,"In terms of the promise it held and the folly of what has found its way to the screen, ""Suicide Squad"" is easily one of 2016's most disappointing films."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,282,"If it were a little better, it would demand a proper autopsy to figure out what the hell happened. (Ayer made Fury just two years ago!). As it is, it just isn't worth it."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,283,"Margot Robbie is a huge movie star who owns this film and every moment she is on screen in ""Suicide Squad"" you get your money's worth and then some."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,284,"There have been worse big-budget bombs than 'Suicide Squad.' But not many of them, and not by much."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,285,"Suicide Squad is a hasty gathering of admittedly fun characters, all jammed haphazardly into a familiar and dumb cartoon tale, handily squandering its potential for edge, daring, or originality."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,286,"The film is a heartbreaking disappointment in several ways, from the overcrowded cast of characters to the uninspired and undeveloped villains to the bland action sequences to the half-baked story."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,287,"Everyone started making a movie before they really knew what they were doing. You need adults in charge, and there are no adults in charge here. The result is, yet again, a total sh-tshow."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,288,"It's like Batman Returns meets Papa Roach -- a transparently skin-deep superhero sizzle reel, which is kind of refreshing when every other comic book movie these days is trying to guide you through the metaphorical levels."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,289,"Who's to say messy can't also be fun?"
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,290,"Muddled characters and uneven storytelling are the roots of the issues here, but the ways in which Ayer seems to try to cover up his film's deficiencies grate most of all."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,291,"Ayer has often been a careless writer, and so he is here."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,292,"If you know someone you really can't stand - not someone you dislike, not someone who rubs you the wrong way, but someone you really loathe and detest - send that person a ticket for ""Suicide Squad."""
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,293,"""Suicide Squad"" is a so-so, off-peak superhero movie. It chases after the nihilistic swagger of ""Deadpool"" and the anarchic whimsy of ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" but trips over its own feet."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,294,"This movie is tripped up by a jumbled narrative and corporate machination: Warner Bros. is desperately chasing the highly successful Marvel film universe, and the only way to get there is to rush."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,295,"Overblown and underwritten, Leto plays the Joker like a pantomime gangster whose only threatening quality is the possibility of more scenes."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,296,"DC's Suicide Squad is rough and jagged, but still entertains. Will Smith, Margot Robbie and the rest of the actors give good performances."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,297,"A fleet of appealing, interesting actors (and Jared Leto) set out to make a DC movie work. Talk about a kamikaze mission."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,298,"After a while, even Ayer's wildest stylistic choices settle down into DC Films' house style: the muted tones and industrial black/blue that Zack Snyder used to build America's visually dullest franchise of the moment."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,299,"A forgiving fan will find moments to enjoy here, but as a whole it's a monumental misfire."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,300,Please let the record show I actually kind of dug the first 20 minutes of so. It was the rest of this movie that did me in.
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,301,"Despite being sold as a team of wacky crooks going on laugh-a-minute hijinks, the film takes itself very seriously."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,302,"Okay, so it's less po-faced and mean-spirited than Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, more colourful, varied and inventive than Man Of Steel. It's probably the least-worst DC movie so far. But these are not the (anti) heroes we were waiting for."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,303,"Delivers exactly what it promises and what you expect. Along with JASON BOURNE, see these two and forget the rest."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,304,A good movie that never gets close to becoming great.
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,305,"Suicide Squad is a solid and entertaining third entry into the DC Extended Universe, one that suggests DC could almost have just as much fun as Marvel. Almost."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,306,"It will be interesting to see where DC takes these characters after the semi-delightful mess that is ""Suicide Squad."" But, for now, just enjoy the sloppy and wild ride."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,307,"The year's most muddled piece of storytelling."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,308,A great premise pitting bad vs badder heads toward the darkness rather than the light but succeeds with a terrific cast including ace performances from Margot Robbie and Viola Davis.
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,309,The result is not so much Suicide Squad as Death by a Dozen Disappointments Squad.
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,310,"Even the idea of nihilist camaraderie, which should come naturally with the Peckinpah-by-way-of-post-Crisis-DC premise, feels like a load of hooey; the characters are often too busy posing to exchange more than a few words at a time."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,311,"[T]akes the superhero genre in a new direction, letting the bad guys be bad guys even while they're forced into service for supposed ""good."" It's crowd-pleasing genre entertainment with delightful performances, [and] eye-popping visuals..."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,312,"A fantastic cast, lighthearted tone, and fun soundtrack make Suicide Squad one of the most entertaining films of 2016."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,313,"David Ayer's flash-and-dash directing style makes it a challenge to follow the story, not to mention a chore to process the onslaught of violence."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,314,The weaker characters and generally weak plot keep it from being one of the better comic book movies.
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,315,"Suicide Squad isn't a typical next step in universe building but it's all DC has going for it right now. Ayer's movie will make a lot of money, but in the black hole of comic geekdom he won't make many friends."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,316,"Suicide Squad is jam-packed with action, star power and mayhem, but a little restraint would've gone a long way."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,317,"It doesn't necessarily fall to this film to define what a villain's journey really means. But like its characters, it's free to operate on its own terms, and it'd be a much stronger story if it took full advantage of that freedom."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,318,"In a year overloaded with comic-book movies, ""Suicide Squad"" just seems like more of the same."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,319,"On paper, this could have been the antidote to an increasingly codified strain of comic-book movies, but in the end, it's just another high-attitude version of the same."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,320,"A gleefully nihilistic, abysmally messy romp that delights in upending the genre's conventions and tries desperately to, like, totally blow your mind with its outre freak show."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,321,"Who stole the soul of Suicide Squad? I'd say it's Ayer's willingness to go all limp-dick and compromise his hardcore action bona fides for a PG-13 crowdpleaser that would rather ingratiate than cut deep, or even cut at all."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,322,"Suicide Squad isn't exactly the movie that audiences are hoping for, and not the bounce-back that the series needed after Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,323,"...a noisy, murky dud where only the lesser known stars make any kind of an impact. ""Suicide Squad"" makes one almost nostalgic for ""Batman v Superman."""
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,324,"It is gleefully nihilistic, and it takes a different approach to what has become a fairly familiar story form at this point, right at the moment when it feels like superhero movies either have to evolve or die."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,325,What a waste of a perfectly twisted Suicide Squad.
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,326,"SUICIDE SQUAD is a mess, but pushing against the current of a botched movie are four lead performances that salvage the whole thing."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,327,"It goes for subversive, funny and stylish, and it succeeds wildly during the first act. But then... It plods on, checking off boxes on a list of cliched moments and meaningless plot points, making you wonder where all the razzle-dazzle went."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,328,"It's probably best to think of ""Suicide Squad"" as a primer, an entry into a side world of the DC Universe that may pay bigger benefits in later films."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,329,"With Jared Leto playing Joker, the promise was of a return to the kind of storytelling found in Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight. Sadly, that doesn't prove to be the case at all."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,330,"So much happens in David Ayer's DC Comics adaptation Suicide Squad that by the end, it's as if you've seen nothing."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,331,"Its structure is messy & its storytelling is incoherent at times, but it looks good, sounds great and pushes the genre forward in some neat ways."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,332,"Harley Quinn is an embodiment of all the conflicting things this frankly disastrous new movie, choppily written and directed David Ayer, is attempting to do."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,333,"Picture a heavy metal bar in suburban Duluth and you'll get some sense of the generic Goth aesthetic."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,334,"The characters are the ultimate in ""squad goals,"" but they're far more fun than the actual story itself."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,335,"Compared to its ilk, Suicide Squad is an excellently quirky, proudly raised middle finger to the staid superhero-movie establishment."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,336,"The story is bad. It's confusing, poorly edited and just way too over the top and contrived."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,337,"It's a clotted and delirious film, with flashes of preposterous, operatic silliness."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,338,"Starts off flavourful, turns rather bland. This Injustice League jaunt proves that DC is still a long way behind Marvel for on-screen action."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,339,"Like Avengers Assemble forced through a Deadpool mangle, Suicide Squad gives new life to DC's big-screen universe. So bad-to-the-bone it's good."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,340,"Occasionally, the film feels like Ayer is trying to fight his way out from underneath an enormous, suffocating parachute."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,341,"It's not satisfying storytelling; the flashbacks roll in and out, explaining either too much or too little, and the action may be violent but it's not interesting."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,342,"Suicide Squad is the rare superhero movie in which I actually found myself wondering about the characters' inner lives."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,343,"For DC, which blew it with Batman v Superman last spring, Suicide Squad is a small step forward. But it could have been a giant leap."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,344,"Sorry, as far as movies about superhero supergroups go? The Guardians, and the Avengers, still have these jokers beat."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,345,"While it's a bright, grimy, candy-colored mess, at least Suicide Squad is here to lighten up the place, break a few vases, take a few shots, and have some fun."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,346,"A puzzlingly confused undertaking that never becomes as cool as it thinks it is, Suicide Squad assembles an all-star team of supervillains and then doesn't know what to do with them."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,347,"""Suicide Squad"" has its kinky pleasures and some amusing nastiness, but in the final analysis there's simply too much flexing of empty attitude -- and far too much self-congratulation for how edgy it thinks it is."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,348,"Haphazardly paced and generically plotted, Suicide Squad benefits immensely from the winning presence of Will Smith's Deadshot and Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,349,"Logic waved bye-bye to Harley a long time ago. Kind of like this movie. But in both cases, it's a damn captivating spectacle to behold."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,350,A twisted B-side to some of the slicker comic book movies.
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,351,"Suicide Squad desperately wants to be irreverent, badass and unscrupulous, but it's patchy moral murkiness is only PG-13 dark."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,352,"Can barely get all of these characters onto a billboard, much less a movie."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,353,"The rare comic book movie that truly feels like it came from one person's wackadoodle vision."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,354,"It's just the kick in the pants Warner Bros. and DC Entertainment need to correct course ahead of next year's Justice League."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,355,"David Ayer devotes the film's first hour to telling us how bad these crazy mofos are (""the most dangerous people on the planet""; ""bad guys""; ""worst of the worst""), but then spends the next hour (...and 10 minutes) trying in vain to make good on the promise."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,356,"Just when you think the summer movie season can't get any worse, along come the 'Worst. Heroes. Ever.'"
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,357,"Bland, boring, and sometimes borderline incoherent."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,358,"Throughout Suicide Squad an unease can be felt, akin to a beast trapped in a PG-13 cage chomping at the bit to get out."
SuicideSquad,SuicideSquad_rm,359,"David Ayer's super-villain team-up is dull, uninspired, and perhaps worst of all, forgettable."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,0,"It's both nostalgic and fresh, a tender homage to, especially, the initial Star Wars (""Episode IV: A New Hope""), as well as a bridge to help those of us stuck in the splendor of Hoth edge into the future."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,1,"The film's political resonances are as mutable - and as muddled - as those of its predecessors."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,2,"If you loved ""The Force Awakens,"" you've already pre-ordered this, and it's worth the purchase price. Just know it isn't ""the complete story behind the making of"" the film that's promised on the back of the box."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,3,"Despite the copious servings of tragic threats and good feelings, the production sinks under the weight of its emotional calculation."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,4,"The new movie, as an act of pure storytelling, streams by with fluency and zip."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,5,"That's what's so impressive about the tricky balancing act Abrams has pulled off with The Force Awakens: He's made a movie that's simultaneously gripping and a huge release. We are in good hands, at last."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,6,"[It's] an end product that caters to the generation who grew up with the original films and inspires them to fall in love with a series all over again while their kids discover it for the first time. The Force is strong with this one."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,7,Director JJ Abrams has crafted a film that is entertaining for non-Star Wars fans and is chuck full of lore and new story for the die hard fans.
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,8,"It's more than another blockbuster; this is a powerful, nostalgic, joyous regeneration."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,9,The Millennium Falcon goes upside down and the screen goes upside down! BB-8 is the cutest! New Star Wars is the best! Pew pew!
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,10,"It's hard to maintain that sense of adventure when you're ticking off points on a checklist. It's fashionable to badmouth the prequels, but at least you could see Lucas working to develop the story, teasing out the implications of his created cosmos."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,11,"This thing is an entertainment orgy of galactic proportions, a fun-filled, planet-hopping, visually breathtaking adventure that gets the next generation of Star Wars stories off to a good start."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,12,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens is a film with a generic, half-baked script. [Full Review in Spanish]"
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,13,"This is an emotional film, engaging in some nostalgia, sure, but also breathing life into a franchise that had become muddled and stuffed to the gills with bloat and ephemera."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,14,"It has some unengaging and familiar story beats that hamper what is otherwise a great return trip to the Galaxy Far, Far, Away..."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,15,An adequate return for the franchise.
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,16,"A perfect balance of impressive action and special effects, some nice humor and several scenes that pack unexpected emotional punch."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,17,"It feels like an exciting time to be a Star Wars fan again. What's more, it's an exciting time to watch a new generation become Star Wars fans."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,18,"""The Force Awakens"" is easily better than all the prequel films, however, I wouldn't rankit higher than anything in the original trilogy except maybe ""Return of the Jedi."""
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,19,"A fun ""remix"", if you will, of what we love about Star Wars. It doubles down on what works and safely doesn't reinvent the wheel."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,20,"There's no reinventing of the wheel here, but an authentic, enthusiastic and well-observed continuation of the universe."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,21,"Having the presence and dramatic lineage of three characters the Prequels weren't afforded the luxury of accessing (Han, Leia and Luke) adds some gravitas to proceedings."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,22,"J.J. Abrams is the right choice to helm this sacred film franchise and present a whole new litany of continuing adventurous narratives for a new generation of 'Star Wars' personalities dipping their tenacious toes into the force of goodness"
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,23,"The Force Awakens isn't the best film of the year but it certainly is one of the best based purely on entertainment value."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,24,It was never going to be easy. Following up the original Star Wars trilogy was a difficult task for its creator George Lucas and his prequel trilogy was met with a lot of criticism and backlash.
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,25,"The nostalgia factor ... is done with great poignancy, adding the emotional beats the film needed to be accepted by the old guard."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,26,The Force is very strong with this one.
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,27,"A key moment... has all the poignancy of discovering an old toy in the attic-or in this case, in the middle of a desert-and finding not only that it still works, but it has a role in saving the universe."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,28,"It's a grand adventure that illustrates how some things might stay the same, but other things can always, always change for the better."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,29,"The same vague, mystical wonder - accompanied by the twittering flutes of John Williams - fills the screen that ran imaginations wild in the '70s."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,30,"There's everything you want in a Star Wars film here and fans of the original will not be disappointed."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,31,J.J. Abrams has succeeded where George Lucas failed: He has remembered what made Star Wars good in the first place.
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,32,"Incorporating old and new concepts and characters together blends wonderfully. The style feels like George Lucas' golden touch."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,33,"What crystallizes the film, especially for veterans of the Star Wars franchise is the sense of history and consequence from the last film in the storyline."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,34,A truly wonderful movie-one worthy of its years-long hype and the Star Wars name itself.
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,35,"The Star Wars film we needed (a palate cleanser). Funny, full of action and lots of feels, this new entry achieves great balance between nostalgia and novelty. [Full review in Spanish]"
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,36,"The Force Awakens is so crammed full of fun stuff it's like an economy-sized jar of Prego."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,37,"If you were worried that this movie was going to be like the prequels, or Star Wars: Into Darkness, do not worry. It captures the heart, it captures the soul, it captures everything that you liked about Star Wars growing up."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,38,This movie carries so much magic.
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,39,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens may not have provided me with an artistic experience, but it did maintain my interest in the rest of the trilogy, and there is something to be said for that."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,40,"Abrams has done a lot more than rebirth this series, he has renewed it with hope for the future"
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,41,"The storytelling is top notch. It's a carefully-crafted dance of nuance that balances a bit of everything."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,42,"It succeeds by managing to be spectacular, thrilling and, as Star Wars past meets Star Wars present and future, unexpectedly moving, too."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,43,"The final product is that The Force Awakens is emotionally satisfying, but you kind of have to play dumb to get along with it. It's a good movie-a really good one, on the surface level-but it falls just short of great."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,44,Abrams seems far more intent on delivering on the promise of the originals as rousing space Westerns where good and evil stood opposite one another and dared the other side to blink.
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,45,"Even if TFA is mostly fan service, I'll take it."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,46,"The new cast is brilliant. I still want to see where Episode VIII goes. But I'm in no rush to see it again as a standalone film."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,47,"... the end result is immensely satisfying, and should be so both for fans like myself and newcomers."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,48,Thank the Maker the Galaxy still has life in it.
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,49,"In short, The Force Awakens does what it needs to do. The familial saga of parents and children, power sought and power won, still sing to us on a genetic level."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,50,"Abrams makes the Star Wars movie every fan wants to see, and it succeeds effortlessly at doing more than merely cashing in on nostalgia."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,51,"I've been sold on the rich possibilities of these new movies. I'm letting the Force in this time."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,52,"JJ Abrams's sequel has, thank the Lord, delivered, with John Boyega and Daisy Ridley proving up to the challenge, too."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,53,"The Force Awakens takes its legions of rabid fanboys very seriously, throwing them meaty bone after bone."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,54,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens gives new life to a franchise of hope, resilience, courage and family that's been missing from theatres for far too long."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,55,"It's a big Star Wars universe out there and Abrams has just made it bigger again with this mix of fan boy homage and a fresh and quirky vision of his own."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,56,"The Force Awakens is fun. I'm not sure that it's great. ... But on the heels of the prequels, well, maybe fun is all we really need."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,57,"As the most anticipated film release that I can remember in some time, ""The Force Awakens"" has some big shoes to fill. And fill them it does."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,58,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens honors the series and takes it in exciting new directions. Both The Millennium Falcon and millennials, it would seem, are in good hands."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,59,"What we've got here is a film that managed, on the first try, to turn the engine over in a car that has been collecting dust for 32 years. Now, they didn't drive it anywhere, so we can't tell if it was worth the effort."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,60,"What is the Force, and Jedi-ism? In Star Wars, it refers to the ability of a high-level martial-artist-knight to use supernormal abilities. Science has proven 6 of them."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,61,"I'm happy to tell you that, despite some minor fumbles, this is definitely the Star Wars film we've been looking for."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,62,"Abrams is trying to recreate that experience for a whole new generation eager to be captured by the charge and action and exotic Amazing Stories covers come to life in a fairy tale space fantasy that takes place long ago and a galaxy far, far away..."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,63,"'The Force Awakens' does what the original films did well - and is also its own, thrilling thing."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,64,"It's fan fiction writ large, making it clearer than ever that George Lucas is ""Star Wars."" With his voice gone, all that's left are tinny reverberations of movie history."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,65,"A trio of writers led by Lawrence Kasdan put the fun and fast-paced serial adventure back into Luke Skywalker's galaxy, and, just as importantly they give us new characters that we care about."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,66,A thrilling outer space epic breathing new life into a once flagging franchise!
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,67,"The return to that galaxy far, far away that audiences have longed for."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,68,This is more than just a nostalgia trip: Star Wars is back and it feels beautiful.
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,69,"While Star Wars: The Force Awakens is technically a remake of Star Wars: A New Hope with some new characters added, it still remains a fun and exciting adventure that does a fine job of blending the old and the new."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,70,"It's Star Wars - right down to its bones - and that's always worth celebrating."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,71,"J.J Abrams has done the impossible; he has created - and recreated - a Star Wars movie and made it look and feel like a Star Wars movie should. Funny, sad, exciting and enlivening, it is a definite and an absolute must-see."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,72,"Despite one too many callbacks to its predecessors, The Force Awakens has all the charm of the best entries in the Star Wars series, and it arrives on a pristine Blu-ray primed to delight the next generation of fans."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,73,"Please, no more sermons about midichlorians and the Force - let's get those light sabers crackin'! And crack they do,"
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,74,Humour and heart are prominent amid the breathtaking action.
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,75,"[Abrams'] plot mirrors that of A New Hope, but deliberately so: it will charm old fans, win many new ones, and make everyone an awful lot of money."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,76,"It's loud and full of vim -- but a little hollow and heartless."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,77,"The Force Awakens is, truly, a stunning exercise in large-scale filmmaking; a beautifully-assembled picture in which Abrams combines a magnificent cast with a marvelous flair for big-screen, sci-fi storytelling."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,78,"Great in the awe-inspiring, tear-provoking way that only films built on generations of dreams can be great... It taps not into what the original films were, but what they meant to audiences, how they made us feel."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,79,The film has an excellent rhythm that gives you but a few minutes to recover from all the action before plunging you right into another battle. [Full Review in Spanish]
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,80,"The film is action packed but driven by the story which is about the people, and specifically family issues which we can all relate to."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,81,"It's thrilling, fantastical and feels like Star Wars."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,82,"The Force Awakens is more of a bridge than a completely new era, but it successfully lets audience live again in a galaxy far, far away."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,83,"If what's contained is ultimately the planting of seeds that will continue growing two, four, or forty years down the line, I suspect this franchise is in its best-ever state."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,84,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens dazzles audiences with a surface of nostalgic fun made shiny new-but beneath that mask, if you care to notice it, lurks an abyss of futility."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,85,"The spectacular 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' provides a new hope for future generations of moviegoers."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,86,A spectacular film that will keep the franchise going for many years to come. [Full review in Spanish]
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,87,"Abrams understands that a great Star Wars movie is not only about the whiz-bang external stuff, but also about the soul in its classic riff on the eternal struggle between the sides of light and dark (good vs evil)."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,88,"Technically a reboot from the original 1977 film, J. J. Abrams breathes live back into the franchise, pleasing old fans and creating legions of new ones. I felt like I was 12 years-old again!"
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,89,"It relaunched the franchise in a real majestic way, mixing new characters with the familiar faces of the original trilogy. [Full review in Spanish]"
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,90,It has all the spirit of the original saga while also introducing new characters for a new generation. It will make you feel like a kid again. [Full review in Spanish]
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,91,"[VIDEO ESSAY] This latest installment of fandom's favorite mongrel pet is a poorly paced MacGuffin-chase plot, ginned up with groan-inducing spoonful doses of pro-war imagery and its attendant rudimentary vocabulary."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,92,"Bravo! Ford ignites the movie! He's the star and jumps right back into the iconic role. Disney brought a princess but it was a bait and switch. They got General Great-Greatma instead."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,93,"As a one-off, the movie might seem like a little miracle - a fresh take on nostalgia not too different in tone from last year's delightful Turbo Kid. But stretched out... a hard crust of cynicism is apparent just beneath the sugar-dusted surface."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,94,"as long as the viewer does not need to contend with Jar-Jar Binks or a pod race, any Star Wars film delivers more than a ticket's worth of entertainment."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,95,It is easy to assume that Lucas sold the franchise to the Xerox Corporation - because the new film is nothing more than a weak photocopy of the 1977 classic and its 1980 follow-up.
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,96,"A canny crowd-pleaser of reversals, replays and reveals."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,97,"Yes, the Force really awakens"
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,98,The creative team is to be commended for a franchise resurrection that catches the spirit of what knocked the socks off a prior generation of galactic film fans. Epic entertainment. Epic movie event.
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,99,"It all comes together nicely as the actors breathe vulnerability, fallibility and personality into their roles, with Daisy Ridley being quite the commanding presence. My favourite, hands down, is the cute and rotund droid BB-8."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,100,"It's precisely what you expect. Nothing more. Nothing less. And there isn't anything wrong with that."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,101,"The Force Awakens is an exciting, nostalgic, powerful and moving film, that is capable of generating accelerated heartbeats and knots in the throat. [Full review in Spanish]"
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,102,Star Wars returns to be fun again on the big screen. [Full review in Spanish]
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,103,"While Star Wars: The Force Awakens gets temporarily bogged down taking us back to the world that we left in 1983, it introduces us to the new and exciting torch-bearers of the franchise."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,104,"At the end The Force Awakens looks more like a nostalgic film that will work as a transition to the new Star Wars' age. [Full Review in Spanish]"

TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,106,"The ingenous script makes the audience get hooked trying to guess the film's next move, only to be surprised when the unexpected occurs. [Full review in Spanish]"
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,107,The Force Awakens is as good as it is bad; fluent as it lacks in emotion; affecting like the original trilogy as much as it is disrespectful with those who seek something new. [Full review in Spanish]
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,108,"It's enjoyable in the moment but leaves us little to chew on, to dream on."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,109,A thrilling outer space epic breathing new life into a once flagging franchise!
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,110,"This was not a movie made under the weight of calculated strategy; it was given life by those who took immense pride in their association, and sought to enhance an established legacy with grand enthusiasm."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,111,"It's like [Abrams] put Episodes IV, V, and VI in a blender. It's an act of love, no doubt about it. ... [But it] lacks any image of its own that is truly iconic."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,112,"There's no end in sight. The force has awakened."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,113,"J.J. Abrams and his crew have restored the shine to our beloved story.The Force is awakened, indeed."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,114,"...the tendency for the narrative to repeat the beats of A New Hope, though perfectly logical in a saga founded upon the constancy of the hero's journey, comes off as pandering fan-fiction."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,115,"This is very similar to the first Star Wars film, but it isn't as family friendly. Hope and optimism are lacking in this reboot. What it lacks in optimism, it makes up for with hype, having been promoted along with every product known to man."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,116,"...secret threads on social media are already picking their nits and debating theories; it's going to be a tough wait to see what happens next."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,117,Springs to life around a terrific new star.
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,118,"What Abrams delivers here is still a pretty good start to this new trilogy, but you can't help but think how great it might have been if they had done their own thing and given us something new."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,119,"Abrams plays it safe, but it's a good kind of safe, because, for the first time in ages, the Star Wars saga has personable leads."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,120,It does exactly what it needs to be a crowd-pleaser in that regard. But whether it breaks any new ground ... not so much.
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,121,"I didn't mind the many nods to the original two movies -- at least they nick story points from the right ones."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,122,Another Death Star-like super weapon?! When will the Empire learn to quit designing them with weak spots where a few well aimed strikes can destroy the entire thing!
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,123,The Force Awakens begins another epic chapter in the Star Wars saga in the best possible way.
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,124,"J.J. Abrams keeps the plot moving at a brisk pace that keeps the viewer from overthinking it until after the credits roll, but not so brisk that we can't relax and enjoy the ride. And what a ride it is."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,125,"It's a well-acted, fun, and zippy time at the movies."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,126,"It's beautiful to look at, brilliantly acted, breathlessly exciting, frequently amusing, yet capable of delivering some emotional gut-punches that take it into the dark territory inhabited by The Empire Strikes Back."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,127,The Force is still here.
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,128,"It's not just a great piece of science fiction, or a great piece of cinema: it's a new hope."

TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,130,"I'd be inclined to give it a honorable third spot, way, ways behind episodes IV and V, and just about the same place as Return of the Jedi. [Full Review in Spanish]"
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,131,"The film is basically a ""greatest hits"" compilation of episodes IV and V, and little else. [Full Review in Spanish]"
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,132,"The light saber is drawn, the battle stance is set, and the Force is most definitely strong with this one."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,133,"A sweeping return to form for the film series, one that is absolutely excellent and will hopefully open the door for more exciting conflicts."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,134,"... a complete fan-service that combines the exciting storytelling and use of practical effects from the original trilogy with the crisp, vibrant color palette and clean computer graphics of the prequels."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,135,"Appealing both to a new generation of viewers and fans of the series since the beginning, this 30-years-later sequel to 1983's Return of the Jedi is a thrilling adventure."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,136,"The force is strong in this spirited sequel. This is the movie that ""Star Wars"" fans have been waiting decades for."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,137,"The Force is with filmmaker J.J. Abrams, who makes sure this Star Wars adventure contains thrilling action scenes, exciting special effects, and colorful characters."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,138,"A money grab in which wunderkind J.J. Abrams choses to go where George Lucas has gone before by basically repeating plot points, even lines, from the original trilogy."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,139,"I found myself listening to a chorus of spontaneous gasps, cheers, laughs, whoops and even occasional cries of anguish. What's really surprising is that many of them were coming from me."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,140,"And just like that, the scars of 16 years and lesser trilogies were magically washed away. We've seen much of what's onscreen before, but Abrams brings a fresh energy to pacing and performances that reminds us of the joy of watching Star Wars films"
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,141,"dishes out familiarity without apology and arranges it in such a way that, even as we recognize the patterns and beats, it feels fresh and invigorating and, lest we forget what's really at stake here, fun"

TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,143,"With The Force Awakens, Abrams has begun one of the most important reclamation projects of our time: the complete erasure from cultural memory of The Phantom Menace and its sequels."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,144,"It's enough to make a grown fan cry."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,145,"Brandishing both a wand and a wink at audiences, and split somewhere between colossal and cartoonish. And no, I am not now nor have I ever been a Star Wars junkie. Akin to an atheist at the church podium. And likely my fate: Let the haters be with you."

TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,154,Three or four moments of astonishing beauty and three or four more that will make you want to cheer. (Fox 29 Philly)
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,155,"I don't think I've ever been so completely satisfied with a film. Considering the insane amount of build up and the wild expectations I had, it's almost miraculous that a film could live up."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,156,"The movie delivers in every conceivable way, on every imaginable level. Star Wars: The Force Awakens is a PhD. level course in Getting It Exactly Right."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,157,"As a stand-alone movie, it's enjoyable but not extraordinary. As a continuation of a franchise, it needs a ""Warning: Under Construction"" sign."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,158,"The rule here is being pleasant, not bold. That is, pleasant to the owners, the empire, the one that paid a ton of money for this cow and it's willing to milk it until there's nothing but dry bones. [Full Review in Spanish]"
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,159,"Obviously, it helps to know the old characters, but Han, Luke and the rest are cultural legends that even the young new fans will know about them."

TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,165,"After George Lucas put is to sleep with episodes I, II and III, the Force is definitely awake. The most fun I've had in a theater this year."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,166,"So go out, get your ticket and join in all the hullabaloo; confident this time you won't get Jar-Jar-ed."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,167,"The familiarity feels good, feels comfortable - ""Chewie, we're home,"" as Han Solo says. But it also hems in the new film's ability to really be its own thing."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,168,"Abrams nails the feeling of (re)visiting a rusted-out, slightly sarcastic fairy tale. Still, a few hours after the credits it's all evaporating and I'm struggling to recall a remotely original or inventive moment in the entire damn thing."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,169,"Ultimately, Star Wars: The Force Awakens wins us over because it is about hope."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,170,"Daisy Ridley, who crosses effortlessly into stardom here, has a face of the sort that cinematographers so often seek in vain."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,171,"Chewy, I'm home."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,172,"There are no midichlorians. There are no fart jokes. No sequences that blatantly scream ""I AM A VIDEO GAME CONCEPT!"" No Gunguns. And it's all wonderful."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,173,"There are echoes of the past in each of these characters, but they resonate in new ways."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,174,"It's a huge amount of fun, although whether the self-referential nature and the did-we-surprise-you-there style of plot reveals stand the test of time remains to be seen."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,175,"[The Force Awakens] rarely stops moving, yet its action never seems excessive. That's because combatants and targets always remain clear instead of fuzzed up by the hyper-speed visuals hack action directors use."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,176,This movie stands proudly as an example of the magic that once was routine in movie theaters. It makes kids of us again and allows us to discover that going to the movies can indeed still be a special event.

TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,178,"There are no glaring missteps in The Force Awakens, and on such a stage this kind of performance might even pass for greatness -- for a little while."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,179,"All points converge for a dramatic, emotionally charged finale, and a lightsaber duel up there with the best of the first trilogy. These fights work best as an extension of the story, not over-choreographed showcases for stunt workers."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,180,"'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' easily lives up to its mammoth hype, but it's not flawless, nor a better film than the original trilogy. It is a non-stop action film with a shotgun pace, like plugging the cotton candy machine directly into your face."

TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,184,"This episode brings warmth back to a franchise more frozen than a dead Tauntaun. Let's hope the second and third movies continue the thaw."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,185,"From old joys to fresh twists, this is a unique blockbuster experience that celebrates the franchise whilst also expanding it."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,186,"The action scenes are excellent, the special effects are superb and there's good doses of humor, suspense and drama all along the way."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,187,"[W]e can sense the film establishing itself as the backbone for a new narrative cycle. It's a promising start."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,188,"Abrams and his fellow writers have gone deep to get back to what Star Wars was and promised to be. Force seeds it well with nostalgia, blood ties and galactic prospects for the next chapters."

TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,195,A thrilling ride from start to finish. [Full review in Spanish]
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,196,"Relative unknowns Daisy Ridley, a legitimate star in the making, and John Boyega sort of pick up where the likes of Leia and Han left off."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,197,"It's amalgam of old and new, a thrill ride that satisfies in its own right as well as in assuaging the fears of fans."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,198,"""Force"" brings fun back to ""Star Wars."""
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,199,The dialogue is punchy. The actors are engaged and human. The action sequences and special effects complement the plot rather than make up for it. The story rockets along.
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,200,A worthy successor.
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,201,"[J.J. Abrams'] ability to absorb other creators' styles makes him perfect for carrying on a series like this."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,202,"But the movie can't sustain its playfulness-or its tension, either. Abrams is too busy trying to roll the original Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back into one two-hour-and-15-minute movie."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,203,"Some with no memory of being swept away almost forty years ago will follow strong new heroes and villains. For those old enough now and young enough then to have childhoods consumed by this stuff, it's a satisfying new turn in a near life-long tale."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,204,"The fun of The Force Awakens comes from visiting an old friend and finding that little has changed; the excitement is that great performances from all four new leads means it's a strong foundation for whatever comes next."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,205,"It's nostalgia-baiting as heck, but also quite forward-looking. While it's an exciting first chapter, perhaps the most thrilling thing about The Force Awakens is what will follow."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,206,"It is a rip-roaring, swashbuckling jaunt through galactic space which will leave you reeling."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,207,"There is, of course, CGI in The Force Awakens, but it's comparatively minimal. The film looks handmade, and this allows for a greater range of human emotion, too. When tragedy strikes, you feel it."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,208,"Finally, I'm able to watch a new chapter of the Star Wars saga and actually look forward to the next film. And man, that's nice."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,209,"The story is compelling. The acting is great. The technical aspects are solid. But it's hard to escape the idea that the film is a remix of something else, an attempt to rework story elements that felt more original elsewhere."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,210,"As with other installments, this is less a movie than an exercise in massaging a juvenile-minded audience that wants the experience to be new and familiar at the same time."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,211,"As a nostalgia trip that knows exactly what die-hard Star Wars fans want and then layers in some memorable new characters, The Force Awakens is exactly what it needs to be: an old-school Saturday afternoon sci-fi matinee writ big."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,212,"Abrams and company have brought Star Wars home again by reigniting the soul, spirit and sense of wonder of the three original films."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,213,"Like their Star Wars forebears, Boyega's Finn and Ridley's Rey are brave, funny, and admirable but also imperfect, uncertain, and sometimes afraid. That is to say, they're genuine, multisided characters with believable motivations."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,214,"Of the canonical films, it's the first in which the humans actually behave and talk like recognizable people."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,215,"The most wildly anticipated and furiously hyped movie of the millennium is finally here and the collective exhalation of relief can be heard around the globe if not the galaxy. Fans can rest easy. JJ Abrams' Star Wars reboot is a triumph."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,216,"Charts a path to a future that refuses to get mired in nostalgia. Yet all the Star Wars notes are here, remixed into a glorious new arrangement."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,217,"Episode 7 of ""Stars Wars"" is an enjoyable retread, full of great new young actors and returning favorites."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,218,"The Force Awakens reboots the franchise right ... so why does it feel like a 'Star Wars' remake more than a sequel?"
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,219,The best disappointing movie ever.
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,220,"If we can't have an original story, in the purest sense, or even original characters, we're asked to be content with a Star Wars film that's aesthetically rich, lovingly made and true to the meat and potatoes storytelling fundamentals of old."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,221,"A rollicking adventure that brings back pure escapism, epic visuals, and boldly designed heroes and villains, making the return to a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away all the more satisfying."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,222,"A near perfect Star Wars film that regular fans and fanatics alike have been waiting for, but it suffers by slavishly sticking to the tropes from the original and doesn't strive to go off script."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,223,"It may be the youngest, but it acts like a middle child-it's the Jan Brady of Star Wars. It's at odds with franchise siblings for attention but there is a deep love for the material; there's charm to the mimicry."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,224,Even before Han and Chewie appear - and what a wonderful reveal it is - The Force Awakens is undeniably a Star Wars movie.
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,225,"Content merely to continue the story...It answers the question ""Where are they now?"" but has no new thoughts or insights regarding the stories we know."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,226,"The Force Awakens is thrilling and fun, but fans of A New Hope might have more than a hint of dj vu."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,227,"John Boyega's Finn - the reformed Stormtrooper with a heart of gold - whoops in delight throughout J.J. Abrams' Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Who could blame him?"
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,228,"Well, was it worth the wait and the anticipation? In my book, yes"
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,229,"The old and the new are seamlessly interwoven in this swashbuckling intergalactic adventure that satisfies on every level with its superb storytelling, endearing characters, splashy visual effects and a masterful score"
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,230,"A swift, entertaining, and comfortable ""Star Wars"" movie, one that will feel familiar to fans of the original trilogy."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,231,"an action-adventure film for the ages. And, bonus, not an annoying Ewok in sight."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,232,"Dramatically, the film does pull some great aces from up its sleeve...The film also proves what a lot of Star Wars fans have long suspected - that the best thing that could happen to Star Wars would be to take George Lucas out of it."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,233,"New planets and old faces, original characters and veterans to guide them - this is a franchise reborn, not reinvented."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,234,incredibly fresh and a whole lot of fun
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,235,"The prequels don't stand a chance - this is as good as fans could have hoped for and better than we deserve."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,236,"J.J. Abrams' homage to the first Star Wars film - the one that took our collective breath away, the one that defined our childhoods - takes ""fan service"" to new heights, which is not necessarily a bad thing."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,237,"'Star Wars' comes full circle... the cherished familiar interlaced with hints of more to come..."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,238,"Just as he did so successfully with the Mission Impossible and Star Trek brands, Abram's has breathed new life into Star Wars; why it should then feel lacking in a strong pulse at times is worth pondering."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,239,"All you really want to know is whether it's good, right? Well, in fact, it is better than it had to be."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,240,"The best, most thrilling Star Wars movie to date..."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,241,"With its breakneck pacing; intelligent and measured reverence for the original films; punchy action sequences; and ambitious plotting, Star Wars: The Force Awakens is a near perfect continuation of the most beloved movie franchise of all time."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,242,"The long wait is over, and the news is good: The Force Awakens heralds the new dawn you hoped for."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,243,A good piece of adventure cinema that never feels like it had a chance of being a great piece of adventure cinema.
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,244,"It's not just a comment on Disney's inescapable marketing barrage, but a sincerely intended complement that the fresh-faced heroes and antiheroes The Force Awakens introduces feels like future friends you've heard a lot about but are only just meeting."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,245,"Star Wars 7: The Force Awakens is a welcome comeback for the franchise, and fan love will be enough to propel most viewers past its flaws."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,246,"Unquestionably the best Star Wars movie we've seen in 30 years, and an undeniably entertaining ride - but one certainly not without a collection of narrative flaws."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,247,"Story and spectacle are what count, and Abrams delivers the latter with deftly realised reprises of favorite scenes and thrilling set piece."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,248,"I don't want you skimming paragraphs trying to find the sentence where I say it's good, so here it is. Star Wars: The Force Awakens is a spectacularly good movie."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,249,"A fast-paced, good-spirited, thoroughly approachable action movie that grabs and keeps your attention from first frame to last"
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,250,"Though the plot is overly familiar, Abrams hits all the right beats and leaves us hungry for the next chapter."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,251,"The first thing I thought as the credits rolled was that I can't wait to see it again."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,252,Out of this world.
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,253,It exists less as a meaningful extension of its world than as a fan-service deployment device.
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,254,"When The Force Awakens gets going, you couldn't ask for a more propulsive, joyous or witty Star Wars film"
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,255,"Kids and adults alike are going to eat this thing up and come back for seconds and thirds, probably in the same weekend, if they can score tickets."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,256,"It's a relief to see a big, splashy movie that actually maintains a sense of childlike play."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,257,"Make no mistake: the new film delivers. It is in no way disappointing, except in its conformity."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,258,"Abrams is a hyper-competent entertainer, and a fan, with an astute understanding of what made the original trilogy appealing."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,259,"Even if this adventure spans the galaxy, Ford's presence tends to bring things down to earth."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,260,"Abrams is also too susceptible to the solemn self-mythologising that always threatened to spoil the fun of any Star Wars film. He hasn't made a terrible picture -- just a safe one, where the farthest reaches of fantasy feel merely routine."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,261,"What [Abrams has] done is to remake Star Wars: A New Hope; tweaking it for the passage of time; improving on the acting, the effects, and the dialogue; and tossing in some bits from its sequels."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,262,"We get to spend a lot of fun and/or dramatic time with Ford's Solo, while Ridley's Rey and Boyega's Finn give us a pair of dynamic new heroes to follow in future Star Wars Episodes."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,263,"Anyone who enjoys the other movies, particularly Episodes 4 through 6, should be perfectly satisfied with the direction of the franchise."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,264,An incredible science-fiction and adventure film. [Full review in Spanish]

TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,266,"Somewhere along the way, Abrams begins delivering everything we expect, as opposed to those nebulous wonders we didn't know we wanted."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,267,"This mediatic circus has entertained me moderately, wishing the film would be a little shorter. What can I say? Not really my cup of tea. [Full review in Spanish]"
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,268,The Force Awakens is a glorious reminder of why this is one of the most beloved sagas of all time. [Full review in Spanish]
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,269,Strives to unite old and new generations of Star Wars fans and mostly succeeds.
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,270,"""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" is simple and highly entertaining, a rollicking adventure that avoids anything about trade federations or blockades."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,271,"The Force Awakens is half reboot, half remake, and all fun."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,272,"J.J. Abrams and team brilliantly merge the old and the new into a Star Wars that soars on every level. Han Solo is back but it is Daisy Ridley's Rey that is the heart of The Force Awakens. She's a keeper."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,273,"From the opening crawl to the ending credits, it's the Star Wars movie we waited decades for, and it sets the stage for even bigger, better and bolder adventures to come."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,274,The Force Awakens works quite well considering it is lumbered with an unshakable neurosis throughout.
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,275,"J.J. Abrams's sleek, feverishly hyped Episode Seven injects the moribund series with humor and humanity, but relies too much on remixed bits from the original trilogy."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,276,"Thrilling and knowing in all the right places, it's sure to satisfy fans that have breathlessly awaited its arrival for years. Unfamiliar with Jedi lore? You too will give in to the force of cinematic greatness."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,277,"The Force Awakens leans heavily on the original Star Wars, and that's comforting for fans, though one hopes [Episode VIII] will take more risks."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,278,"It's a brilliant next step in the saga, and it leaves you wanting more... which is exactly what it needed to do."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,279,"The nostalgic callbacks are so insistent that they can stop the narrative dead, like when some real drama is about to go down but everything pauses so we can have a meet-cute with C-3PO. Even the main villain comes off as some emo Darth Vader fanboy."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,280,"It's a solid space opera spectacle with enough nostalgia to overpower even the most hard-hearted child of the '70s and '80s but it relies a little too much on recycling old plot elements."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,281,"There's plenty to enjoy here, whether you're a casual fan or someone who was blown away a long time ago, in a theater far, far away. (Full Content Review for Parents -- Violence, Profanity, etc. - Also Available)"
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,282,"Personally enjoyed the hell out of it; critically, I felt, OK, this is a really good start and a step in the right direction with room for improvement."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,283,"For the first hour or so of The Force Awakens, director J. J. Abrams gives you everything you hoped for, and even exceeds your expectations."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,284,"To millions of moviegoers, the force is with us once again, and that is good."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,285,"With the care of a true fan, Abrams melds the old with the new, bringing in fresh elements while reintroducing the characters and themes fans have loved for nearly four decades."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,286,"Exhilarating, if highly derivative...an enjoyable throwback that is largely content to replicate its models rather than taking the narrative in any significantly new direction."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,287,"Director J.J. Abrams is like a kid trying to cram in as much playtime as possible before bed. His enthusiasm is infectious, almost overwhelming."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,288,"Star Wars has returned to us again, and it brings us a wonderful gift: a brand new chapter, mixing old and new elements, original and new cast, in [an] amazing picture."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,289,"It is not a little disheartening to see this new 'Star Wars' installment not blazing its own path but rather chasing its tail and rehashing its former glories for our approval."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,290,J.J. Abrams rescusitates the series far more in keeping with the original trilogy than their creator George Lucas did with episodes I-III. The Saturday morning serial feel is back...
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,291,"A fun if uneven return to a galaxy far, far away."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,292,"Its script is ludicrous, riddled with coincidences and a fealty to existing text that a less forgiving person might call lazy. Yet I can't wait to see it again."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,293,The force is strong in this one.
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,294,A return to the levity of the original trilogy. Ford is as good with zingers as he is with blasters.
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,295,"... ""Star Wars"" feel like ""Star Wars"" again ..."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,296,"""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" is the ""Star Wars"" sequel we have been looking for: a classic adventure that harkens back to the glory days of 1977's ""Star Wars"" and 1980's ""The Empire Strikes Back."""
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,297,"This is a movie you don't want to end, despite a final shot that is one of the greatest in the franchise's storied history. Abrams has righted the ship. The ""Star Wars"" saga is back, and we are gleefully in it for the long haul."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,298,Delivers an effective mix of nostalgia and new storylines. Disney pulled off a modern-day Christmas miracle keeping the plot almost completely unknown to audiences. My advice is keep it that way.
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,299,"'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' is exactly the movie you want it to be."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,300,"An exhilarating ride, filled with archetypal characters with plausible psychologies, melodramatic confrontations fueled by soaring emotions, and performances that can be described as good, period, rather than ""good, for 'Star Wars.'"""
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,301,It gives us what we want. And what we want is more of the same.
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,302,"Harrison Ford and Peter Mayhew, playing Han Solo and Chewbacca, are flat out terrific delivering one-liners, slap-stick, and heart, which transcends mere nostalgia."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,303,"Star Wars has come roaring and soaring back with a fabulous, bountiful, richly rewarding payoff for anyone who's been waiting, patiently or otherwise."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,304,A Star Wars film by fans and for fans.
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,305,"Abrams understands viewers don't tune into soap operas for pretty pictures: they watch for story and characters, which explains why the filmmakers pushed so hard to keep plot details under lock and key."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,306,An Episode IV for a new generation is only as good as the reminder to the old of why they fell in love with these movies to begin with.
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,307,"This is the beginning of something. It's a farewell to the old guard and a welcome to the new. As such it's hard to begrudge the film its plethora of callbacks, repeated plot line and heavy exposition."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,308,"Thrilling, exciting and dazzling with a heartbeat underneath. Star Wars: The Force Awakens delivers everything you want in a Star Wars movie. It's worth waiting in line for, and lives up to the hype."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,309,"For me, there's nothing to be done during Star Wars films but wait for the occasional bit of comic relief."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,310,"A triumphant return to form for the franchise - the best of the films since The Empire Strikes Back...It's also a rousing introduction to new characters who will likely carry this world forward through two more planned episodes and assorted spinoffs."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,311,"...baldly trades on its predecessors, but with enough artfulness and genuine affection to count as its own unique experience."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,312,Director JJ Abrams has delivered the Episode 4 fans were looking for in 1999.
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,313,"What's really surprising too is just how emotional it all is. More than just nostalgia, The Force Awakens earns its tears. Star Wars is back in a big way: as C-3PO might say, thank the maker."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,314,"Slick and stylish, the evolution of the world of ""Star Wars"" is fully realized with sumptuous sets, vigorous and energetic cinematography, and impeccable sound work."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,315,"Granted, director J.J. Abrams leans a little heavily on the nostalgia, but given all he had to accomplish in this massive franchise reboot, can you blame him?"
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,316,"Ridley and Boyega make a sizeable impact amidst the cacophonous sound and merchandising fury, capturing the vulnerability and anguish of conflicted characters haunted by murky pasts."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,317,Fans will get goosebumps right from the start as the scrolling summary to bring us up to date - without a single mention of tariffs or bureaucratic squabbles.
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,318,"Perhaps another director will pick up the elements that Abrams left scattered about, imbue them with some... any kind of subtext, to give us some real poetry."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,319,"I enjoyed the seventh Star Wars film more than any since The Empire Strikes Back and much more than - yes, reader, I was there, for this newspaper, reviewing it - the now 38-year-old saga start-up."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,320,"If the original created dreams, the latest creates nightmares."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,321,"Star Wars: Episode VII -- The Force Awakens marks the Star Warsiest movie since Return of the Jedi, a fun and fantastic blend of old memories and new blood, old enemies and new friends, old actors and really old actors."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,322,"[Abrams ] has made an adoring copy of Star Wars, seeking to correct its perceived flaws, without understanding that nothing about that movie's context or meaning or enormous cultural impact can be duplicated."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,323,What Abrams has done is find and return the ingredient crucial to the original three films in the franchise that was sorely lacking in the second round: fun.
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,324,"Against the odds we've ended up with the first authentic Star Wars film since 1983. Now who'd have seen that coming?"
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,325,"It is a warm and shrewd reminder of what we loved about the films in the first place; if only it wasn't quite so deferential."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,326,"The Force Awakens isn't just one the finest movies of 2015, it's the best movie of the year, full stop."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,327,"Not for nothing, but John Williams' score is absolutely perfect as usual, and it makes every one of [the action] scenes come to life all the more."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,328,"Go see The Force Awakens with an open mind, and without expectations of the same lightning being captured again in the same bottle. It is, at the end of the day, a movie. And it's a pretty good one."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,329,"These young people are a spirited bunch, led by Daisy Ridley and John Boyega, two bright-faced newcomers who lend the proceedings the appropriate sense of grounding and awe."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,330,"Even if it isn't the greatest Star Wars film ever, it's almost certainly the most affecting of them all."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,331,"At the risk of committing blasphemy, ""The Force Awakens"" is the best of the seven ""Star Wars"" -- followed closely, of course, by the 1977 original."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,332,"Ford especially earns his money with this one. But as fun as it is to see Han Solo back in action, the newcomers like Ridley take center stage, launching subplots that should be fun to watch in ensuing installments."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,333,"The best thing that can be said about The Force Awakens... is that it's classicist in the way of a well-executed neo-soul record, crackling with familiarity without bowing to the altar of history."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,334,"The Force Awakens drowns in the shadows cast by the original Star Wars films. Its stunning visuals and breakout performances from the new cast can't save the identity crisis The Force Awakens suffers from."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,335,"If you were to make a list of the essential ingredients of a Star Wars film, you would find almost all in J.J. Abrams' wake-up call to this sleeping giant of a franchise."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,336,The Force Awakens has all of the strengths of the original trilogy and none of the weaknesses of the prequels.
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,337,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens is actually probably objectively the best Star Wars yet, and would be held up as untouchable had it come first."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,338,It is precisely the Star Wars movie that you want it to be. This is the one you were waiting for. You may be waiting just as intently for the next one.
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,339,"With The Force Awakens, Abrams got to build a whole new universe on a base of returning favorites. No character is stronger, though, than Rey (Daisy Ridley), who is the central player in the new story."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,340,"The Force Awakens is just such an exhilarating experience, it's very nearly everything you could want from such a large-scale spectacle."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,341,"For all of its humor and charm and thrilling dogfights and genuinely teary moments (I'm not made of stone, people), The Force Awakens revels in its derivative nature, in its open-armed embrace of warm nostalgia."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,342,"""The Force Awakens"" is satisfying on its own (no half of a ""Hunger Games"" movie here), but it also sets the stage for these new characters to go off on some great adventures in episodes to come."

TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,346,"Though a definite improvement on the last three abortive ""Star Wars"" prequels... ""The Force Awakens"" is only at its best in fits and starts, its success dependent on who of its mix of franchise veterans and first-timers is on the screen."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,347,"If Hollywood's going to extend the most famous movie myth of the past 40 years, ""The Force Awakens"" seems a worthwhile way to do so."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,348,"This, undoubtedly, is the movie that fans wanted, the movie that fans deserve."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,349,"[Star Wars: The Force Awakens] returns the iconic sci-fi franchise to a glorious place that hasn't been seen since Ewoks danced off into victory in Return of the Jedi 32 years ago."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,350,"The seventh installment in the series, started by George Lucas in 1977, is the best Star Wars sequel yet and one of the best films of 2015."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,351,"The Force Awakens pops with memorable battle sequences, gives us chills with encore appearances by stars from the original trilogy and introduces more than a half-dozen terrific Next Generation characters."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,352,"When The Force Awakens ends, it feels bittersweet simply because you so badly want to get to the next chapter. So, yes, the wait is over. But now a new waiting game begins..."

TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,354,A glib facsimile.
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,355,"[The film] is a state-of-the-art throwback, both retro and post-modern in its self-awareness. It doesn't just know that it's operating in the long shadow of a classic; it hardwires that understanding into its own DNA, making legacy a prevailing theme."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,356,"You WILL like this movie. No, that's not some kind of Jedi mind trick, accompanied by a vague wave of the hand. It's a educated prediction, grounded in -- well, the Force if you must know. And don't tell me the Force doesn't work that way."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,357,"Pleasingly, this isn't a film that takes itself too seriously, with the seriously cute BB-8 supplying plenty of humour with his electronic beeps and chirps and no end of playful references to the original trilogy crammed into the 135-minute running time."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,358,Abrams seems content to capture the spirit of the original series and simply remix the rest of it until Star Wars miraculously seems fresh again.
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,359,"JJ Abrams has perfectly captured the spirit of the original trilogy, with great characters, terrific action set-pieces, and a surprising amount of humour."

TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,361,"Ridley, Boyega and Isaac make equally charismatic heroes, and Driver is surprisingly effective as the sinister Ren. Star Wars: The Force Awakens is commercial American moviemaking at its best. May the Force be with it."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,362,"The formula, more than the Force, was with Abrams. He was wise enough not to mess with it."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,363,"Is The Force Awakens equal to the original trilogy? Fans will have to face facts: Such unique magic can never be recreated... The new Star Wars films must create a universe of their own -- and they're off to a promising start."

TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,372,"They got the job done with The Force Awakens, and while Abrams pays more homage than he rightfully should, he also introduces the most exciting characters Star Wars has seen since, not going to lie, Lando Calrissian and Lobot."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,373,"It has the usual toy-store-ready gizmos and critters, but it also has appealingly imperfect men and women whose blunders and victories, decency and goofiness remind you that a pop mythology like Star Wars needs more than old gods to sustain it."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,374,This is a triumphant reboot of the biggest film franchise of our lifetimes and fully earns its place as the soon-to-be biggest film of all time.
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,375,"While The Force Awakens belongs to the younger generation, Ford dominates its throwback element like a true, ahem, force of nature."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,376,Perfectly safe and plenty full of the Force... but leans on geek nostalgia to reboot a beloved property by hitting predictably familiar story beats.
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,377,"Rest assured fans. You won't have to complain how Abrams further ruined your childhood. This is everything we initially loved about the franchise and exceeds expectations."

TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,387,"When the first Star Wars film was released in 1977, nobody had seen anything like it. Almost 40 years on, the trail it blazed is now so well traveled, it's on every intergalactic tourist map.That makes Abrams' feat all the more impressive."

TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,397,"It's an entertaining but ultimately lightweight bridge between the classic movies and Disney's apparently never-ending slate of upcoming feature films."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,398,A remix of the original STAR WARS that is saved by wonderful new iconic characters.
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,399,"""Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens"" is a special kind of blockbuster, wondrous and thrilling and not in the least hampered by cynicism. Don't be surprised, adults, if watching it makes you feel like a kid again."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,400,Star Wars: The Force Awakens pumps new energy and life into a hallowed franchise in a way that both resurrects old pleasures and points in promising new directions.

TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,405,The best new Star Wars film in three decades and one of the most satisfying films of the year.
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,406,"A remarkable achievement that actually feels like Star Wars again, more so than any film since 1983."

TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,408,"Masterfully marrying new with nostalgia, this is the one we've been waiting for."
TheForceAwakens,TheForceAwakens_rm,409,"The rollicking, space-opera spirit of George Lucas's original trilogy (you can safely forget the second trio of cynical, tricked-up prequels) emanates from every frame of J.J. Abrams euphoric sequel."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,0,"""Star Wars"" is not ""Breaking Bad,"" and the same narrative tricks that worked for the latter feel jarringly out of place in the former."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,1,"What's most interesting to me about The Last Jedi is Luke's return as the mentor rather than the student, grappling with his failure in this new role, and later aspiring to be the wise and patient teacher."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,2,"Fanatics will love it; for the rest of us, it's a tolerably good time."

TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,6,"[It] is the best kind of entry into a franchise that takes unexpected risks, keeps you on the edge of your seat, and is emotionally moving in a way that will be leave fans stunned."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,7,"Let's not mince words: This will be remembered as one of the best science fiction/fantasy movies of all time, and this backlash simply must stop, because that's no way to treat a near-masterpiece."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,8,"Unnecessary the longest Star Wars film to date, but has some of the most epic ground-breaking moments in the franchise."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,9,A lot of the films ideas I like in theory but it was not executed well. The more I thought about it the less I liked it

TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,13,Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a complete shift for the Star Wars saga and a brave reinvention of the jedi mythos. [Full review in Spanish]
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,14,"It's great to have a filmmaker who evidently has been a fan of the franchise since he was a kid, but still also an 'outsider' who dared to take the 40-year-old saga into unexpected paths."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,15,"It's a visually stunning movie, finding moments both macro and micro to highlight the beautiful imagination that Star Wars can evoke."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,16,"I should say, that Star Wars the Last Jedi is the best Star Wars film we have to date by default. This film is a natural progression of the Star Wars films because it incorporates all the good things we loved about the previous Star Wars films."

TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,18,The film is a great reminder to listen to your elders. [Full Review in Spanish]
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,19,"An enthralling and gripping piece of cinema that's both sublimely moving and visually beautiful, The Last Jedi, while flawed, is ultimately a breath of fresh air."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,20,[Rian Johnson] captured the tonal spirit of the preceding episodes and elevated it through bold and fresh ideas.
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,21,"When it works, it really works, but the fat overwhelms it all too often."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,22,"The film starts off great and ends great, but sags in the middle. Still, well worth your while going to see, as it gives a good send off to a beloved character."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,23,"A brilliant continuation of the saga that legitimizes the sequel trilogy and Disney's handling of the franchise.."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,24,"The Last Jedi is Disney's best contribution to the Star Wars canon so far and we can only hope that the final film of this trilogy will live up to the new standard."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,25,"The Force Awakens came for your heart, but The Last Jedi is here for your spirit."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,26,The Last Jedi is certainly an adventure that will pull you this way and throw you that way but never ceases to be anything but Star Wars
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,27,"The Last Jedi is a powerful, emotional and ambitious film that makes for one of the best films in the series."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,28,"The film examines a questioning of ideals held throughout the ages, a deconstruction of what we know and hold dear."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,29,"Director Rian Johnson takes some major risks here. Some of them work well while other choices contribute to the film's uneven tone."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,30,"It might not be what I wanted it to be, but I can't deny I was entertained."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,31,"If The Force Awakens was an exercise in nostalgia, The Last Jedi is an experiment of expectancy. It pushes the boundaries of its characters, its audience, and the franchise's capacity..."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,32,"The Last Jedi isn't the Star Wars installment anyone wanted. It's the one we all deserve."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,33,"A problem that carries over from The Force Awakens and becomes more evident here is the sense that the villains, and villainy in general, have been weakly determined."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,34,"Like bantha fodder riddled with kyber crystals, The Last Jedi is a jumble of really good and kinda bad."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,35,"A glorious cinematic tour-de-force, a sci-fi gift that never stops giving, a real achievement."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,36,The Last Jedi offers aimless entertainment.
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,37,"The film breaks many franchise traditions on all levels, but it does so with a lot of respect and with the ambition to build something new and exciting from what remains."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,38,"If Awakens was about The Resistance and The First Order repeating the cycle of The Rebellion and The Empire, this one is all about how they have to become their own things and what the proper way to get there is going to be - and that's exciting."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,39,"The Last Jedi breathes urgent purpose into the new trilogy, purpose it had yet to prove."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,40,"More than merely a continuation, The Last Jedi is in many ways an ending to the Star Wars we've known. And like many endings, it's anarchic and frustrating and poignant."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,41,"Whatever the future holds for Star Wars, The Last Jedi will leave a lasting mark on this legendary series with numerous moments that are shocking and powerful with just enough humor to cut the tension."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,42,"It's safe to say ""The Last Jedi"" is one of the best ""Star Wars"" movies ever made. It's right up there with ""Empire Strikes Back."""

TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,44,"Big, bold and beautiful. It's hard to describe Rian Johnson's achievements here any other way."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,45,"Rian Johnson's Star Wars: The Last Jedi manages to be both brilliant and terrible at the same time, a mix of classic mythos and insipid story telling."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,46,"In every aspect conceivable, the film no longer operates between two realms, and the result is the most gratifying big-screen Star Wars experience thus far."

TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,49,"Star Wars: The Last Jedi works. It's macro and micro stories entertain, either if you're predisposed to like what it has to offer, or at least not actively resistant to it."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,50,"But on many levels, The Last Jedi is the antithesis of the virulent discourse it generates: a reminder that flaws can give way to strengths, that being willing to be wrong is a strength, and that doing the work, not getting the credit, is what matters."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,51,"Whereas the first half is a sort of a convoluted mess. ""The Last Jedi"" becomes a dark and exciting sequel that becomes the film you've been looking for by the 75-minute mark."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,52,"The success of The Last Jedi, like its father before it, will most likely rest on the conclusion of the trilogy."

TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,54,"It's a two-and-a-half hour movie. It needs to be good in its own right, not just setting up for the next episode. A two-and-a-half hour, $200 million set up?"
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,55,"If you're a fan, you're going to appreciate the story continuing (on and on). If you're into makeup and CGI, you'll appreciate every minute of it."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,56,"It calls the very idea of solo heroism into question. There are plenty of daring heroics in The Last Jedi and no shortage of characters who want to step into Luke's or Han's shoes, but now that impulse is shown to just make things worse."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,57,"Along with non-stop action, there seems to be more wonder, whimsy and humor in The Last Jedi, some of it deliciously subtle."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,58,"When it comes to pop cinema at this massive level, isn't it better for a movie to take Imperial-sized chances than just giving you what you want? I'll go with yes."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,59,"Johnson takes the narrative through its paces, weaving a complicated and fascinating story. Just when you think one thing is going to happen, the story shifts."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,60,Thoughtfully humane and visually epic.
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,61,"A wonderfully directed, acted, and progressive film. Though it takes place in a galaxy far far away, the emotions and politics are very much here on earth today."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,62,"Whereas JJ Abrams's The Force Awakens delivered a nostalgic joy that focused on reigniting a legacy I grew to love and obsess over throughout the years, Rian Johnson instead creates a nostalgia towards my years of childhood imagination."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,63,"With deep reverence for what has come before, Disney has proven that they aren't afraid to move the story forward."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,64,"The best ""Star Wars"" film since the original trilogy."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,65,"It is overall, a good movie worth watching. And timely, as our own modern-day First Order takes roots."

TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,70,"Star Wars: The Last Jedi may not be perfect, but the need to accept imperfection and keep going becomes one of the movie's themes...It's about mentorship that's invigorating rather than smothering."

TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,74,"The highs definitely outweigh the lows, and The Last Jedi is in the upper tier of films set in that far, far away galaxy."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,75,The evolution of all the new characters was really good.
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,76,"It's a Force to be reckoned with."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,77,"Even if the stuffed-gills plot grew frustrating, I'm still looking forward to the next foray into a galaxy far, far away."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,78,There is just enough good material embedded in the excessive padding to appeal to our cravings for more Star Wars.
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,79,"When a character is in danger, you do feel that danger...there's something about the craftsmanship in this one. That feeling of security is gone, but the movie has a lot of humor too."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,80,"The new, machine-tooled The Last Jedi is sufficiently busy (action scenes occurring every ten minutes) to make you grateful that it is, at least, agreeably paced, even if it isn't really about anything."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,81,"I both loved it and strongly disliked it at the same time. I feel like there's a really great movie in there, all the pieces are there, everything is brilliant, but then there's a lot of extra fat that needed to be trimmed off or rearranged."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,82,"At two-and-a-half hours, with about nine separate cliffhanger endings, it's a bit long, but Johnson's keen visual sense, doses of humor and a couple of cameos buoy the film"
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,83,"There's a lot to like in the new Star Wars film...But it is not, as so many are saying, either the best Star Wars movie ever nor even the best since The Empire Strikes Back."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,84,"The music still feels fresh and Rian Johnson's film will please the fans with its wonderful visuals and abundance of action. But for me, there was something missing."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,85,"The story is compelling and there are some good characters to follow on this journey through many twists and turns. The acting is solid, and the visual effects are top notch. This is an impressive effort by writer-director Rian Johnson ('Looper')."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,86,"The mission is noble. The result, disastrous. [Full review in Spanish]"
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,87,"A red throne room evokes the Technicolor fantasies of Michael Powell and Vincente Minnelli, while the scratchy surfaces of a sand planet trace the arc of each combatant's footwork like a choreographer's notation, transforming a duel into a dance."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,88,"There is simply no joy in The Last Jedi. But all great legacies, I guess, are destined to fade."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,89,"It's fun to look at."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,90,"Same effects, new cast. Some should stay and some should go."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,91,"A stellar, if slightly overlong, followup to 2015's Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens..."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,92,"Daisy Ridley is always in motion. Her role of a young warrior is intense, but her moments with Adam Driver, comparing good and evil, are good, indeed."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,93,"The thing that makes the film most interesting is its function as a bridge between two paradigms, really two distinct generations, Boomers and Millennials."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,94,Jedi offers a rather bold reinvention and expansion of what the Star Wars universe is capable of.
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,95,"That's when the film offers moments... that go from euphoria to sadness, from fear to uncertainty, and from incredulity to the unexpected; moments that will surely be established as some of the best in the entire franchise. [Full review in Spanish]"
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,96,"Considering that the franchise returns to Abrams in the next installment, surely the producers will ask for neatness and solemnity ... for old times sake. [Full review in Spanish]"

TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,98,"The Last Jedi has been favourably compared to The Empire Strikes Back and while there's some truth to that, they're very different films. Yes, it's dark but it's the moments of light that you'll remember."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,99,"I know I'm in the minority here, but director Rian Johnson's follow-up to The Force Awakens felt overstuffed and incredibly disjointed; a collection of uncorrelated rah-rah scenes and little else."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,100,"Writer-director Rian Johnson repeatedly shows an inability to build to moments. His screenplay's biggest beats come off as self-defeating and lifeless."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,101,"They ticked off all the boxes except the one marked ""Jar Jar Binks."" You are very old if you needed to see all these characters again."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,102,A fantastic sequel...
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,103,"With a script by director Johnson, ""The Last Jedi"" is a mash-up of many different stories, but all with the same main plot line; good versus evil."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,104,"If you can accept the excess, the weird humour, the entirely inessential subplot, and the fact that it could stand to end a scene earlier, then the series will continue to thrive in a galaxy far, far away."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,105,"Where Abrams left us eager for more, Johnson leaves us sated and willing to wait a couple of years for the next episode. Still, there's plenty of fun to be had, and the series faithful won't be disappointed."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,106,The Last Jedi tackles the bigger questions that the morally sure previous entries did not.
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,107,It is the best and most innovative Star Wars film to come along in a long time and you would think that this would inspire celebration in the streets among longtime fans of the franchise.

TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,109,"""The Last Jedi"" is not a crude predictable entry to the series; Rian Johnson has delivered a luminous spark that's left the future of the franchise looking bright."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,110,... the director manages to raise a moving monument to something as brilliant and even corny as the possibility of a shared dream. [Full review in Spanish]
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,111,"Digressive rather than progressive, The Last Jedi fails to develop the new, exciting and complex characters we met in The Force Awakens."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,112,"Abrams gave us the gentle re-introduction we needed, and it paved the way for writer and director Rian Johnson to take the story in strange new directions."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,113,"Luke Skywalker rules all in this movie, but there's a lot of stuff that doesn't work."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,114,"Although not worse than the prequels for me, The Last Jedi is its own special kind of meh that demonstrates Disney doesn't have the guts to do this franchise any justice."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,115,"Over-funded, bloated, self-important and virtually immobile, The Last Jedi bears more than a passing resemblance to Jabba the Hutt."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,116,"This movie feels like a TIE fighter on the fritz, spinning in circles as it fires off one light-show after another."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,117,"Here, [Mark] Hamill turns in his best performance, giving the character a depth and complexity that wasn't as evident in the original trilogy."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,118,"With Johnson at the helm, the torch-along with the lightsaber-is safely passed to a new generation."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,119,the most interesting people are no longer related to Darth Vader
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,120,"While a good Star Wars film, this was not the best. With issues across the board (technical, character and plot), The Last Jedi does leave much to be desired."

TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,122,"There's a sense of closure. Which makes The Last Jedi an incredibly cathartic experience."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,123,"It's nice that the Rebellion is no longer defined by suicide attacks and The Force no longer a matter of hereditary title."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,124,Rian Johnson leavens political high seriousness and fan-service tear-jerking with enough charm and humour to prevent The Last Jedi becoming the biggest downer ever delivered at Christmas by the Walt Disney Company.
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,125,"More good things and fewer bad things happen in this movie than in any of the three prequels, but the film is hellbent on presenting its good things in the worst possible light."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,126,"What The Last Jedi does so well over its two-hour, 32-minute thrill-ride is start to escape the gravitational pull of orbiting the same Skywalker family squabbles on the big screen for 40 years."

TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,132,A thing of beauty and work of art about which the loudest grumblers likely expected the most conventional developments - lost in Reddit rabbit holes and clickbait in which creatives graciously fielded insistent questions about parents or provenances.
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,133,"Each of these characters finds a surprising connection to others, derailing plans and sending each person on an unexpected journey. The way Johnson orchestrates all of this is remarkable because it's both coherent and compelling."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,134,"The Last Jedi is a grand step forward, one that we can only hope will light the way for the franchise's future."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,135,"With Star Wars: The Last Jedi, writer-director Rian Johnson takes the Star Wars saga into uncharted territory, with exciting results."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,136,"Its scattered pacing and tangled subplots doesn't make THE LAST JEDI a failure, but neither is it a celebration - or more importantly, an elevation - of anything other than the legacies of the late Carrie Fisher, and justly revered Mark Hamill"
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,137,"In The Last Jedi, movie magic has been replaced by hocus pocus. Or perhaps even mumbo jumbo -- never has the eastern-western pop psychology of the franchise rung so hollow."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,138,"The Last Jedi is good, in parts very good but not as good as The Force Awakens. It's too long but not tedious, it's often funny and full of action."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,139,"From the seemingly infinite number of universes in which The Last Jedi was a bad film, or even just an OK one, Johnson has found his way to the one universe in which it is a good, occasionally first-rate one."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,140,"For those of us who were there at the start, there's one thing that makes The Last Jedi unmissable: Carrie Fisher. Go and see it for her."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,141,"This chapter relies so much on its call-backs and references that it all feels a little bit too safe. But still a damn fine movie, pushing the story forward in style."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,142,The Last Jedi should be the last Jedi. My interest died along with Hans Solo who took with him that cowboys in space humor that made the franchise so special.
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,143,"As the third act approaches, the crescendo of air-punching interludes accelerates, eliciting gasps, cheers and OMG whoops from an audience whom Johnson treats with respect, affection, and evident admiration."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,144,"It's a bold and challenging work -- exactly what we would expect from the auteur of Brick and Looper. In the debit column, it's also a tad bloated."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,145,"Rian Johnson has delivered arguably the best Star Wars ever, or at least certainly the most fun."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,146,"With The Last Jedi, there's a welcome return of hope for the Sequel Trilogy."

TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,152,Its nostalgia works well. Mark Hamill returns as Luke Skywalker and the late Carrie Fisher is again in her signature role of Leia Organa.
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,153,The Last Jedi brings to the audience something much more complicated for a movie to cause than tears: chills. [Full review in Portuguese.]
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,154,What serves filmmaker Johnson well is his willingness to take more risks within classic elements than Abrams may have been able to. The real measure of the success of a film in a franchise of this stature is whether or not it ignites the imagination.
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,155,"While The Last Jedi may not receive top marks for originality, the eighth official entry in the Star Wars saga is still one of the most entertaining blockbusters of the year..."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,156,"... if all you want to know is can you go in expecting a good film, the answer is yes. A resounding yes!"
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,157,"Star Wars: The Last Jedi successfully combines the thrill-a-minute fun that's always been part of the saga with a fresh spin on the light/dark theme embedded into the epic tale's DNA."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,158,"With every super-spoilable turn, 'The Last Jedi' anticipates backlash, and asks longtime devotees to look inward."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,159,"This delightful if overlong film has so many arcs and subplots that you'll find yourself parsing them later... not because they don't work, but because the film packs so many scenes that reward closer-than-normal observation."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,160,"Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a spirited continuation - sometimes spectacular, often humorous - of the never-ending space saga."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,161,"With The Last Jedi, Rian Johnson's done to the Star Wars franchise what Joss Whedon had done for Marvel with The Avengers. Disney and Lucasfilm have another solid franchise base in the offing now."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,162,"These are small choices, but important ones. The kind that make us care. The kind that make us ask, Who hurt you? Kylo Ren may be a boy at heart, but he's a villain in full."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,163,"With The Last Jedi, Johnson finds that sweet spot of reverentially seeing out the old to firmly make way for a new, perhaps final, space odyssey."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,164,"Hope for generational change, the power of any single, small, nameless dreamer, who may yet know a world not manipulated by gunrunners, moneychangers, the venal and power-mad. Forces against The Force. The sky is filled with more stars than we know."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,165,"There are more genuine laughs and emotional resonance here than any of the movies have managed since 'Empire' ... But does it have even a fraction of the weird cross-genre spark that animated the original trilogy? Not at all."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,166,"With deft direction by Johnson and his script that has its ominous and mythical moments but never quite feels over-the-top or silly, this features strong work from Hamill, Ridley, Driver and Boyega."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,167,"A poignant farewell to Carrie Fisher. With dynamite women leading the action on all fronts, The Last Jedi is a fitting tribute to her legacy."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,168,"Even if real fanboys are not pleased with some of the revelations (and, perhaps, not all should be believed), the major impact of The Force will go a long way in keeping everyone relatively happy."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,169,"The battle that inaugurates The Last Jedi is now and in the eyes of a lonely child, the ray of light in the sky that awakens his imagination. [Full review in Spanish]"
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,170,"Arguably the most beautifully directed film of the series so far. About as good as it gets for four-quadrant, tent-pole film-making. Wonderful."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,171,"The Last Jedi is awe-inspiring and poignant. Expect to be riveted, despite its runtime of two-and-a-half hours."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,172,"Overall, Star Wars: The Last Jedi is an engaging mesh of new and old threads of past and present Star Wars narratives coming together to make a cohesive and exciting film."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,173,"It's all watchable to those of us in the Skeptics Tribe. I tacked on an extra half star to the star rating for this solely because of my outsized affection for a glorious section in the middle that I enjoyed as I have few other Star Wars side journeys."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,174,"Sci-fi violence, strong female characters in thrilling epic."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,175,"[Rian] Johnson's miscue has posed a disquieting question: Are these filmmakers authors or fans?"
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,176,Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a muddled movie that has some incredibly high points and beautiful scenes... [but] also contains a lot of distracting filler.
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,177,"It's a Rian Johnson film through and through, which is why it feels like a breath of fresh air. [Full Review in Spanish]"
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,178,"There are also quite a few new creatures, among them various icicle dogs, turtle-face monks, and some impossibly cute thingies called Porgs, which look as if they nest in gift shops at night."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,179,"However, as much time and energy has been devoted to the goings on of Rey, Ren, and their various friends and enemies, try as the film might, it doesn't generate much in the way of genuine interest in these characters."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,180,The film is a relentless crowd-pleaser that has as much in common with a pedigreed art film as it does a traditional action blowout.
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,181,"The characters, like the movie, take what they need from the past, leave the rest behind, and forge ahead into unexpected and exciting new terrain."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,182,"Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a visual spectacle that expands our understanding of the Force and how it shapes a ""galaxy far, far away,"" adding to the mythology and lore of this franchise."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,183,"Just like The Empire Strikes Back set the benchmark for the ""orig trij"", The Last Jedi does the same for the sequel trilogy."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,184,Johnson - like George Lucas before him - has an eye for capturing epic moments that simultaneously feel effortless and throwaway.
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,185,"In short it is a dynamic, action-packed addition to the 40-year-old series that no self-respecting fan will want to miss."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,186,Remixing the structure of the originals with the aesthetics of the prequels.
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,187,"Rian Johnson's film is the real deal, a bold, risky venture unafraid to tell its own story, freed from the weight of nostalgia and formula."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,188,A profound spiritual experience.
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,189,The Last Jedi represents a triumph for the series and will make you forget Jar Jar Binks ever existed.
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,190,"Johnson ends the film with the rebel forces on the defensive and with their resources mostly spent. Yet he offers a sliver of hope - there's that word again - as he assures us, when the screen fades to dark, that brighter days are ahead."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,191,"Demonstrates an understanding of the Star Wars universe and its appeal, while also taking it into wonderful new directions"
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,192,"""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" reminds us all over again why this franchise is so beloved."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,193,"I can say that the film is visually spectacular, with another superb soundtrack from John Williams, and mostly well cast."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,194,"Johnson is easily the most skilled filmmaker to helm one of these (it's not even close) and it's not just that the film has a surface beauty of its own. He's aware of what we expect narratively from a 'Star Wars' movie, and delights in subverting it."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,195,But the biggest thing this eighth chapter does is change where things go next in a fundamental way.
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,196,"Armed with intelligent dialogue, fully dimensional characters, and the requisite wowie-zowie audio-visual effects, the Rian Johnson-Walt Disney Pictures-Lucasfilm-Ram Bergman Productions of Star Wars: The Last Jedi is pretty darned good."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,197,"The Star Wars franchise is in good hands with writer-director Rian Johnson, who delivers an enthralling, often funny and at times achingly beautiful galactic adventure in The Last Jedi."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,198,"By being easily the most unconventional film in the octet, The Last Jedi underscores exactly what Star Wars was always about. Hope. We need it now more than ever."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,199,"It's easy to forget the original movie was a terrifically bold, innovative, industry-realigning blockbuster. Lucas dreamed big and took massive risks. In that sense, The Last Jedi could not be more different to the Star Wars created four decades ago."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,200,"Writer and director Rian Johnson will surprise you with new story possibilities, new emotions, new visuals to feast your eyes on."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,201,"... plenty of twists, turns and pleasant surprises to hold an audience rapt over the two-and-a-half-hour running time."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,202,"The Last Jedi is the best Star Wars film since 1980's The Empire Strikes Back because it's so much more than stars and wars. It's those stories, joys, and pains of the heroes, villains, and nobodies who lived it."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,203,"In practically every frame, writer-director Rian Johnson conveys how much fun it is to do this stuff."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,204,"an entertaining, engaging ride, and it's all thanks to having a true filmmaker behind the lens"
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,205,"Rian Johnson understands how to balance the strengths of the franchise, which is simultaneously a fun action-comedy for kids, and a decades-long epic with meaty philosophical themes."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,206,"Whew! ... The Last Jedi thankfully returns to the tone of fun, adventure, and especially camaraderie that J.J. Abrams established so well in The Force Awakens."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,207,"[Johnson] clearly knows the material well enough to give us exactly what we expect, and he loves it enough to take it into new territory."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,208,"Moving on from previous glories to start anew furnishes greater moments for the characters than the story, but it adds to a movie that's thoughtful, emotional and contemplative."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,209,"If the previous entry presented a respectably staid melding of old and new, this one wires everything up, cranks the juice, and lets her rip."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,210,"There is a thrilling space opera somewhere in Star Wars: The Last Jedi, if only it could rise above the echoes of its original mythology."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,211,"Epic, fun, visually sumptuous, it will tug at your heart strings because we come to know the characters across several episodes and we root for them when we recognise our own emotional responses in theirs."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,212,"The Last Jedi is not a film for the faint of heart. But courage, a sense of wonder, a resounding faith in the strength of love, and a healthy dose of hope will take you far."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,213,"Rian Johnson's wildly fun and thoughtful entry into the Star Wars canon finds its heroes at a precarious turning point."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,214,"The movie's richness invites more than one viewing."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,215,"The Last Jedi continues that transition in a way that will gratify those who were around for the beginning of the series. In other words, let the space exploration continue."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,216,"Certainly J.J. Abrams' 2015 ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" was more than satisfying, but Johnson steps it up several notches, digging deeper into characters, and even adding nuance to the ""Star Wars"" mythos."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,217,"Even with the warts, Star Wars: The Last Jedi feels like a big, dazzling holiday present most Star Wars fans should be able to tear into and enjoy."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,218,"The Last Jedi is built on a series of oppositions relative to one of the best known films ever made. It's the prisoner of its middle chapter predecessor."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,219,"The Last Jedi is a sample of what Disney intends to do with this franchise, turning it into a product full of cliches, empty plots, forgettable villains, [and] one-dimensional characters. [Full Review in Spanish]"
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,220,"Nothing less than the smartest, most nuanced, most ambitious Star Wars film ever made."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,221,"Sporadically thrilling, but overlong, exhausting, tonally uneven, and often dull."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,222,"Johnson works in the somewhat limited palette that is Star Wars, but this middle chapter in the new trilogy also starts to break out in ways that should excite fans at the prospect of what's to come."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,223,"With the passage of time, The Last Jedi may rise again as a necessary film, essential between one and another of the saga. [Full review in Spanish]"
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,224,"The forceful 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi' is a cinematic triumph."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,225,"Simply put, if you love or even just enjoy the ""SW"" universe and its various trappings, you're going to, at a minimum, find this one to your liking. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, etc. - also Available)"
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,226,"Nothing in ""The Last Jedi"" is allowed to be mundane, including the places the filmmakers take the story."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,227,"But these are minor quibbles compared to the depth, wonder, and sense of heroism that The Last Jedi brings back."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,228,"In the end, ""The Last Jedi"" delivers everything you would want from a ""Star Wars"" movie, something that's become both a blessing and a curse."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,229,"There are twists you won't see coming and just when you think you've figured everything out, Rian Johnson pulls a rabbit out of his hat."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,230,"""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" could very well be the definite evolution of the series yet."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,231,"Rian Johnson, writer and director of this film, took my Star Wars reveries and served them back to me with vast improvements."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,232,"Has fresh story beats and new ideas ... Yet as the complicated, messy plot unfolds, the lack of a larger vision in this new trilogy becomes more glaring."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,233,"Rian Johnson's middle chapter in the current Star Wars trilogy is the epic you've been looking for. Capped by Mark Hamill in the performance of his career, it points the way ahead to a next generation of skywalkers - and, thrillingly, to a new hope."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,234,"The true star is Mark Hamill, giving the performance of his career as the anguished, isolated, tortured former Jedi Master. His scenes are worth the ticket price alone."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,235,"Muddled by bombast, but it finds significance in the art of failure as a means to an end for a new beginning (again) for Star Wars."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,236,"The dialogue is peppered with droll admissions and Star Wars-savvy sarcasm, which helps to prick the heroic sweep so common to these trilogies."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,237,"Where J.J. Abrams sought to give this new trilogy a firm but predictable foundation to build upon, Rian Johnson's The Last Jedi is a risk-taker. This is to be applauded absolutely."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,238,"Unjustifiably long and with misplaced humour throughout, The Last Jedi nonetheless delivers some scintillating action, spine-tingling lore and a loving farewell to Fisher."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,239,Goes in bold new directions while delivering familiarity. Written and directed with thoughtfulness and visual flair.
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,240,"Movies should be better than those we could imagine up on our own. Rian Johnson knows what we want to see, and shows it to us in ways we couldn't have envisioned without him."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,241,"By now, the franchise is mainly about giving the audience more of what it's already given it, and the gifted writer-director Rian Johnson (Looper) delivers just that..."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,242,"...a great Star Wars film, one that honours the traditions of the franchise but boldly pushes the envelope in terms of thematic complexity and emotional tone..."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,243,"The Last Jedi deserves nothing but acclaim, and Johnson, an incredibly adept director, deserves to be handed as many future Star Wars films as he can manage."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,244,Lucas Hit the Jackpot!
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,245,"A reboot of Empire Strikes Back, Star Wars: The Last Jedi is overlong, heavy-handed and fun if mostly uninspired."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,246,"Older characters pass the baton to a new, female-centric generation led by the outstanding Daisy Ridley, the new face now a confident actress with great screen charisma."

TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,251,"What's most thrilling about The Last Jedi is Johnson's seamless blending of old and new Star Wars lore."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,252,Star Wars fans old and new are guaranteed to have an absolute blast.
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,253,"The Last Jedi suffers from occasional inconsistencies in character and plot, but these quibbles are easily absorbed into the impressively vast and colorful canvas that Johnson paints with such passion and empathy."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,254,"Thankfully The Last Jedi won't be the last Jedi movie, but it should be your next."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,255,"Fisher would be proud of Episode VIII, an injection of freshness into a series always only one movie away from staidness -- such is the scrutiny of something as loaded as Star Wars."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,256,The force is still strong with this one. It just takes the occasional wobble.
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,257,"For all the complexity of the sub-plots, the storyline is reassuringly familiar."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,258,"Big space battles are one thing, but there are smaller action setpieces here that can only be described as beautiful."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,259,"Carrie Fisher, in her final Star Wars performance, is the heart and soul of the film, stealing scenes with ease and on more than one occasion bringing lumps to the throat."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,260,"There's a refreshing gender balance among the key characters. Laura Dern's Vice Admiral Holdo may be dressed more for the opera but don't be fooled, kids."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,261,"Bottom line: ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" may not be the best installment in the now 40-year-old franchise, but it packs enough action and surprises to keep fans happy through the Christmas season and beyond."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,262,"[Daisy] Ridley already proved herself a worthy addition to the Star Wars fold and does nothing here to convince us that we weren't right to welcome her for what evidently will be a long run."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,263,"The series feels like it is truly moving forward for the first time in decades, and that future now looks more promising."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,264,"It's full of moments both thrilling and poignant, with anticipated reunions and goodbyes, and pulse-pounding action."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,265,"While The Last Jedi acknowledges the inevitable comparisons to [The Empire Strikes Back] by setting up some similar scenarios, it then does original and surprising things with those moments."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,266,"Entertains as comfort food in filmic form, but this is an altogether slighter experience than the spectacular one ""The Force Awakens"" provided. This is a fine film in spite of its many issues, easily recommendable to fans."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,267,The last act overcomes a sluggish middle and is as thrilling as this franchise ever gets.
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,268,"The Last Jedi delivers the all-too-rare thrill of a huge popcorn movie that respects the intelligence of its audience, while also serving up plenty of moments designed to make them lose their damn minds."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,269,"It's a compelling feature for the most part, but it's too obsessed with surprises, often sacrificing stability just to rattle fans."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,270,"Gorgeous cinematography, solid performances & one of the best scenes in Star Wars history. Though, it has issues incl. unnecessary comedy that affects tone. Liked but didn't love."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,271,"Regardless of the jokes and explicit exposition, there was enough real emotion to make me care. Given the absolute ridiculousness of what happens in this unapologetic space soap opera, making me feel anything at all is an undeniable measure of success."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,272,...a bit of a placeholder.
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,273,"So much movie, I think my engorged eyeballs had to stick a finger down their throats and vomit out a couple of epic battle scenes just so they could get through the finale."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,274,"The Last Jedi is an epic to inspire, an adventure that truly carries you to a galaxy far, far away, and will hold in your heart as all the best stories do."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,275,"[The Last Jedi] features some of the best drama, comedy and action of the whole series, as well as more visual invention than ever. [Full review in French]"
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,276,"The Last Jedi repeatedly goes against your every instinct, takes your emotions for a roller coaster, and takes the characters we know in directions that will blow your mind."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,277,Director/screenwriter Rian Johnson has truly delivered the galaxy goods on this event-the second installment of the sequel trilogy.
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,278,[Johnson] does his best work in The Last Jedi when he stops trying for narrative complexity and just stages some cool outer-space action.
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,279,"It arrives at a very dark moment indeed, and yet like the movies that preceded it, it speaks very powerfully to where we're at right now."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,280,"There's a sense that Johnson is giving busy-work to certain characters while others are catching up. The Last Jedi is a great 105-minute movie stretched too thin."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,281,[Rian Johnson] achieves what no one else has since The Empire Strikes Back: a fusion of junkyard genre parts and passion.
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,282,"On the whole, this is a great step forward for the franchise - it's deeper, it's darker and it has porgs."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,283,"Nothing can prepare you for what Star Wars: The Last Jedi delivers and that's exactly what makes so damn near perfect."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,284,"While I have laughed at times during previous ""Star Wars"" movies, I did not expect to do so as quickly as ""The Last Jedi"" made me."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,285,"[Rain] Johnson crafts an entertaining, swashbuckling flick in the series' eighth film. It possesses the whimsy, the heart and light sabers necessary for reverence in the Star Wars canon."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,286,"This is a movie not only for Star Wars fans but also for fans of losing themselves in, and falling in love with, blockbuster movies. That's a feeling most Hollywood movies have forgotten-and The Last Jedi is here to make us remember it."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,287,"While familiar, this is a Star Wars film that isn't overly beholden to its past, playing with the tropes, themes, and characters of its predecessors in a way that is both unsettling but necessary."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,288,"[Director Rian Johnson's] movie has a sense of humor about itself and a sense of joy, but its emotional generosity, even in the midst of all the extravagant green-screen work, is its best special effect."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,289,The spectacles in Star Wars: The Last Jedi are some of the most powerful and believable in the franchises.
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,290,Have we ever had a relaunch followed immediately by a reboot?
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,291,"Star Wars: The Last Jedi launches the franchise to another level of action and humor thanks to incoming writer-director Rian Johnson, whose imagination seems boundless as George Lucas' 40 years ago."

TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,295,"Johnson has delivered the goods: a film that isn't afraid to be ambitious, that delights and dazzles in equal measure, while providing a worthwhile emotional investment. It is a crowd-pleaser that will be wholeheartedly embraced by fans."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,296,"It soars and sinks, shrewdly building on franchise lore while scoring cheap shots against capitalism. Frustrating it is, hmmm?"
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,297,"As indebted to the previous installments and ""Star Wars"" canon as it is to classic Westerns, sword-and-sandal epics and martial arts films.... it's the blend of reverence for its roots and embrace of the new that makes ""The Last Jedi"" a triumph."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,298,"A stunning black, white, and red color pallette, thrilling adventure, appealing new characters, worthy developments for old friends and a cause to root for."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,299,"Star Wars fans, your sky high expectations are rewarded. Rian Johnson takes the fabled lore from a galaxy far away into uncharted territory. He will have you spellbound."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,300,"The movie comes off as a work that's ironed out, flattened down, appallingly purified."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,301,"Rian Johnson clearly remembers something that Lucas' most fervent followers sometimes forget: These are movies for the young, or at least the young at heart."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,302,"The Last Jedi is that very rare thing, a brilliantly crafted, intelligent blockbuster that will deserve every penny of its doubtless immense box-office returns."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,303,"Efficiently manufactured and enjoyable enough but overloaded with action and effects, and sorely lacking the magic that marked the first movies in the franchise."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,304,"The Last Jedi boasts many very good performances, ones that enrich the characters and which salute writer/director Johnson's ability to find the humanity within technology, something he proved early on with his artful time-travel thriller Looper."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,305,A blockbuster with the beating heart of its creator worn proudly on its sleeve.
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,306,"[G]ets off to a bit of an uneven start, but finds its footing eventually... not the best of the series, and not the best of the new films, but it's still a worthwhile entry in the continuing saga..."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,307,"A spectacular, full-throttle joyride of thrills, exhilarating, screen-filling visuals, emotional heft and humor, with familiar characters and new faces we'll almost certainly be seeing again."

TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,310,"Without giving away any surprises, there will be endearing reunions, unexpected appearances and outcomes... [Full review in Spanish]"
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,311,"There's a trick to taking something old and making it bigger and more impressive, yet familiar enough to sate our desire for the same. With Last Jedi, Johnson pulls it off assuredly enough to please nearly everybody."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,312,"The Last Jedi, however, opens up some new possibilities. It doesn't provide a ton of satisfying answers, but it creates some interesting questions. And it manages to make ""Star Wars"" feel new again."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,313,"Perhaps like no film in the franchise yet, 'The Last Jedi' seriously considers the hubris that comes with certainty, and how knots from the past that can keep you bound from moving forward."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,314,"While the central story concept of THE LAST JEDI, Luke's Dharmic apotheosis and Rey's Gnostic enlightenment, is a brilliant one, it's hounded by lopsided execution and a ham-fisted subplot..."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,315,"Every moment where The Last Jedi almost takes a bold risk for the series, it undermines itself to maintain the status quo."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,316,"Disney found a true ""Star Wars"" champion in Johnson and I'm eager to see what he does when he's able to craft the next trilogy from scratch."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,317,"""The Last Jedi"" may not possess its immediate predecessors' pleasant shock of the new, nor is it a stylistic detour from what's expected. But it makes up for this with wit, spirit and one wicked saber smackdown."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,318,"It's a film of genuine beauty, one where you come away as eager to talk about the set design and the choreography as you do the fate of the galaxy or what might happen next."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,319,"""The Last Jedi"" is a rousing, stirring adventure that is consistently guided by the courage and fallibility of its characters, culminating in a sustained, riveting finale that overpowers any quibbles about pacing and plotting."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,320,"[Johnson's]often-stirring addition to the saga finally lands on an affecting point about the importance of preserving essential cultural tradition without clinging too strictly to the dogma -- and the texts -- of the old way."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,321,Fans can expect plenty of surprises and awe-inspiring visual wizardry.
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,322,"After this - I never thought I'd say it - I'm up for more. Bring on the next Star Wars."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,323,"The first half of the movie works in fits and starts, but Johnson makes up for it in the second, when the bundle of subplots intertwine tighter, and the narrative rockets forward, its action fleet of foot and tightly tied to its emotional highs."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,324,Everything a fan could want from a Star Wars film and then some.
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,325,"[Rian] Johnson's passion ends up giving wings to these last Jedi who, although wounded and disenchanted, resist stronger than ever. [Full Review in Spanish]"
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,326,"While there are elements nodding to The Empire Strikes Back, The Last Jedi is no copycat. In its most daring moments, it even tweaks a few series tropes, updating them with a decidedly populist kick."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,327,"Writer-director Rian Johnson has certainly made the busiest Star Wars film of them all, but he keeps it from becoming a slog by infusing it with humor, verve, and visual charm."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,328,"Splits its attentions between two threads, but only half delivers spectacularly with heart, thrills, and some truly beautiful story beats while the other limps through space."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,329,"""The Last Jedi"" has as much heart as it has guts and that's a stirring combination. You walk out of the cinema reminded why it's sometimes worth fighting a battle you may well lose."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,330,"Rian Johnson's main feat is being savvy enough to know that sometimes the best thing to do is cherishing the past before burning it to the ground."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,331,"But gradually, Johnson's many additions become too much of a good thing and The Last Jedi grows crowded, busy and long."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,332,So many elements in Episode VIII are recycled that it could have been called Rerun of the Jedi.
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,333,"Falsely epic, uselessly lyrical. [Full Review in Spanish]"
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,334,"Last Jedi is deep. It's also rollicking. It's right up there with the very first Star Wars in terms of its enjoyability factor. It's a triumph."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,335,"When everything pulls in the same direction, as it does consistently in ""The Last Jedi,"" it's like watching a mind-boggling clockwork click into a deft ballet."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,336,"That said, I'd stop short of calling director Rian Johnson's undeniably impressive initiation into the Star Wars fold the masterpiece that some desperately want it to be. The film simply drags too much in the middle."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,337,"You cannot kill the past. What you can do is build on it to enable an intriguing future. At the very least, The Last Jedi does that."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,338,"[Carrie Fisher] is luminous here. Every time she's on screen, it's impossible to look away, and she is as tough, loving, and wily as we would ever want our Leia to be."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,339,"The emotional pay-offs are huge, the visuals are stunning, the performances are brilliant and, even as it eagerly explores the darkness, The Last Jedi never loses sight of its heart."

TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,342,"It feels fresh, exciting and playful, without losing the operatic grandeur Star Wars thrives upon."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,343,"If Star Wars: The Last Jedi isn't a complete deconstruction of the original trilogy, it's at least an acknowledgement that these archetypical characters must evolve in order to survive."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,344,"It's not a perfect movie by any means; some of the comedy is a little too silly and one or two of the plot threads feel a bit less important than the others, but these quibbles were minor when compared to the parts that work. Those REALLY work."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,345,"The Last Jedi at its heart is a love letter to a childhood. From Luke's sly wink to an old friend to General Leia's leadership, the familiar heroes dominate the screen, earn the biggest applause and serve as a compass to the next generation."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,346,"The Last Jedi opens up with one of the best space fights the series has seen, and it carries that quality throughout. It has one of the best light saber fights, one of the best endings, and some of the most fun the series has seen."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,347,"It provides top-drawer popcorn entertainment for the casual cinema goer, while hardcore fans will love it for the respect it has for the franchise history and for what it promises for the future."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,348,"My favorite among the new castmembers is Laura Dern as Leia's Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo, a poker player of near-Vulcan inscrutability."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,349,"This is a GREAT Star Wars movie, possibly the best. It's certainly more satisfying and easily the most emotional."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,350,"This mid-section marker in the current trilogy simply doesn't disappoint, realising the courage of its convictions with an intelligent story and a heart-swelling emotional resonance."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,351,"The Last Jedi is a top-of-the-line, A-plus Star Wars and scifi movie -- one that we'll be watching and discussing for as long as there's a galaxy far, far away."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,352,The movie suffers a little from uneven pacing and occasionally lost my focus here and there but it is a worthy addition to the canon.
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,353,"The Last Jedi is not just a bold, fresh and humorous new addition to the franchise -- it's the one that will change it forever."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,354,Mark Hamill has never been better in his interpretation of Luke Skywalker. [Full Review in Spanish]
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,355,"An excellent middle chapter bursting with wit, wisdom, emotion, shocks, old-fashioned derring-do, state-of-the-art tech, and stonking set-pieces."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,356,"Taken as a whole, this eighth episode of the franchise will be porgnip for the faithful, though the answer to one of its Big Questions seems disappointing, and generously entertaining for the rest of us."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,357,"For those hoping that there may have been a substantial uptick in quality between J.J. Abrams's The Force Awakens and Rian Johnson's The Last Jedi-in much the same way that The Empire Strikes Back improved on Star Wars-you may need a new hope."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,358,"When the feelings come in The Last Jedi, and they do come, they're deep and they're real. Go ahead and try to watch the penultimate scene without crying, or pretending not to. And may the Force be with you."

TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,361,The future of the galaxy has never been in safer hands.
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,362,"Propped up by strong material, every member of the Star Wars: The Last Jedi cast delivers performances worthy of the iconic franchise, but deserving special mention is Mark Hamill."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,363,"It certainly captures the sense of awe and imagination of what we love best about that universe. While it's not entirely without faults, it is entirely entertaining."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,364,"Star Wars has been with us for four decades now, telling that same essential story in a format that's overwhelming and engulfing. With wit, skill, and love, The Last Jedi takes up the torch and carries it for a new generation."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,365,"By breaking down some of the old mythology, [Rian] Johnson has staked out new territory. For the first time in a long time, a ""Star Wars"" film feels forward-moving."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,366,"The Last Jedi works on several levels, but most importantly it's a rip-roaring good time. That's what Star Wars fans want the most, and that's what they get with this dynamite installment."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,367,Star Wars: The Last Jedi is the perfect antidote to the year that is 2017 and introduces the tonic for what we need to enter 2018: hope.
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,368,"Sure, The Last Jedi can occasionally be too goofy or free-roaming for its own good, but it's an impossible film to sit in front of and not have a good time."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,369,"Time and again, [Rian] Johnson finds a cinematic grammar that feels new to Star Wars; big close-ups (tender touching hands), top shots, elegant camera tracks and pulling out in-world sound, leaving just music and image."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,370,"The Last Jedi is funny, it's emotional, it's fast-paced and it has a good story to tell."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,371,"... The Last Jedi challenges itself with moments that, if mishandled, could easily have tainted beloved Star Wars moments in the same way that many people feel the prequel trilogy did. Instead, it navigates those narrative rapids with aplomb."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,372,"[Rian] Johnson's ability to deliver a fresh and engaging riff on this beast of an enterprise suggests that not every free-spirited storyteller can be corrupted by Hollywood's dark side, and some may even give it a new hope."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,373,"The Last Jedi is the best Star Wars film since The Empire Strikes Back, and is awful close to being its equal."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,374,"You don't see many sci-fi action extravaganzas that are about late middle-aged disappointment, about wondering what it's all about and whether any of it was worth it. It's this element that gives ""The Last Jedi"" an extra something ..."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,375,"A nuanced, touching, humorous adventure, laced with thrilling space battles and some jaw-dropping visuals."

TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,382,"Everything is respected, but nothing is sacred. It's a sweeping gut-punch. How it deals with our own hopes and dreams for these characters, and how deep it cuts into existential concerns that drive us all - its effects will run around in the mind."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,383,"A fresh visual style makes this middle ""Star Wars"" a welcome addition to the saga."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,384,"No matter how many exotic creatures & internecine struggles that galaxy far away may accommodate, it is a remarkably closed system, reechoing the same themes across the ages, & preferring regression & eternal return to anything like real progress."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,385,"Every new Star Wars movie since Disney bought Lucasfilm has been heralded as the first worthy successor to the Original Trilogy, but with The Last Jedi it's finally true."

TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,395,"That's not to say Star Wars: The Last Jedi will go down in history as a better movie than the franchise's gold standard, The Empire Strikes Back, but director Rian Johnson has pulled off a complete rejuvenation of the saga."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,396,"'The Last Jedi' is not a great movie because it's a 'Star Wars' film. It reasserts 'Star Wars' as a top-tier blockbuster franchise by being a great movie."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,397,"Writer/director Rian Johnson's entry into the Star Wars canon is rebelliously bold at times and full of rousing surprises, which make up for a few lulls in the lengthy two-and-a-half-hour run time."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,398,"The Last Jedi provides a resoundingly positive answer to an old smuggler's long-ago query: ""Let's see what this piece of junk can do."""

TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,403,"Optimistically, The Last Jedi leaves plenty of intriguing possibilities for the climactic installment. But there's also the kind of room for improvement that remind us when it comes to Star Wars, such hopes -- new or otherwise -- spring eternal."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,404,"More than anyone else on screen, Driver seems to know exactly how to pitch his character. He is magnetic in his scenes, and his sequences sing with (space) operatic melodrama that, for all its showiness, is absolutely correct for the piece."

TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,411,"It is a satisfying, at times transporting entertainment. Remarkably, it has visual wit and a human touch, no small achievement for a seemingly indestructible machine that revved up 40 years ago and shows no signs of sputtering out (ever)."

TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,413,"This is the first Star Wars movie made by an artist instead of a craftsman, and it leaves us on the verge of something new. I'm very, very excited to see what that might be."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,414,"Still, this is no mere placeholder of a story. Huge, important things happen to characters secondary and primary. Surprises big and small abound."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,415,"Put simply, The Last Jedi is lodged several parsecs up its own black hole."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,416,"No romance, little pathos and lacks a single heartfelt punch-in-the-gut moment."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,417,"I'm so thrilled that I'm able to say that Star Wars: The Last Jedi made my heart soar and filled me with happiness. I'm heartened to say that it did our Carrie proud."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,418,"Johnson has crafted such a powerful, screaming geekgasm of a movie."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,419,"The Last Jedi gives you an explosive sugar rush of spectacle. It's a film that buzzes with belief in itself and its own mythic universe - a euphoric certainty that I think no other movie franchise has."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,420,"The most intelligent film in the franchise by several light years, The Last Jedi can be seen as the space-opera equivalent of Clint Eastwood's revisionist western, Unforgiven."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,421,The miracle of Star Wars: The Last Jedi is its rejection of series formality. Writer/director Rian Johnson manages to honor mythology while also having fun disrupting it.
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,422,"It may sound like a backhanded compliment, but with so much on the line, Johnson deserves credit for not messing things up."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,423,"The Last Jedi goes big on identity, confusion and loss as [Rian] Johnson puts characters through the existential wringer like no Star Wars director before him."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,424,"Rian Johnson's Episode VIII is a true space opera-a masterful blend of humor, fun, and pathos that bares the souls of its characters and pushes the franchise to new heights."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,425,The best Star Wars since The Empire Strikes Back.
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,426,"Johnson has made something that isn't just a worthy addition to one of the most fan obsessed franchises ever, but is also a powerful standalone story."
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,427,No one can say that Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a previous entry in a different skin as Rian Johnson has crafted an installment that largely defies saga standard narrative structure and tone
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,428,Rian Johnson has created a movie that is both quintessentially Star Wars and richer than anything that has come before.
TheLastJedi,TheLastJedi_rm,429,"For all its strengths, The Last Jedi is a very manic film, fueled by excellent ideas that could have been parsed out in smarter ways."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,0,"Tessa's got the comedic timing to match Taika Waititi's Thor humor, and the physicality to lead the movie's pack of superheroes. She's not trying to outdo the boys; she's just trying to sip her drink and mind her own business."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,1,"Audiences seem to be smart enough these days to know a good movie when they see it, and to avoid a bad flick despite Hollywood's best efforts to pull a fast one on them."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,2,Perfectly acceptable as an action movie but inspired as a comedy--which is probably where the Thor franchise should have been aiming from the start.
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,3,"This viewer ... was wowed in fits and starts, but mostly filled with a new, ungrudging respect for Hemsworth."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,4,"Cate Blanchett's Hela is hella mean, hella snarky and hella striking with her hair slicked back into antlers."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,5,"The idea of pairing the oft-dull Thor with a series of oddball companions is an inspired, if necessary, move - so much so that it's baffling it has taken Marvel this long to smarten up."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,6,Thor: Ragnarok has plenty of visual flair and some laughs.
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,7,"Easily the best Thor movie in the MCU! You will be laughing until you cry, and crying until you laugh. Be ready for one of the most epic battle scenes you will ever see!"
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,8,"Thor: Ragnarok works because it's something you haven't seen before, and that is down to one person - director Taika Waititi."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,9,"Before Thor: Ragnarok, I wasn't checking for another Thor film. Post-Ragnarok, you can give me as many Thor sequels as you want...just make sure Taika Watiti is at the helm, and Tessa Thompson is (drunkenly) lurking somewhere on-screen."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,10,Everybody involved is firing on all cylinders and clearly having the time of their life.
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,11,"Ragnarok gives the genre a much-needed injection of humour and eccentric flair and I think it's not an exaggeration to say that Taika Waititi has saved a superhero."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,12,"There is never a dull moment in this film, which has more comedic moments than drama - which is a far cry from the first two films."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,13,"You would think it'd be tough to live up to the super fun trailer with the rousing Led Zepellin's Immigrant Song, but the movie manages to do just that... and then some!"
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,14,"There's a welcome sense that Ragnarok does not emerge from a solely American perspective in the way that other Marvel films do."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,15,Thor: Ragnarok is the most fun and by far the funniest of the Thor movies.
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,16,Thor: Ragnarok is everything that you want a Marvel movie to be.
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,17,"Going into the film, I was very concerned about the comedy being overbearing. Waititi created a perfect blend of both drama and humor that essentially made the movie even more so entertaining."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,18,"I was never not entertained and it's constantly funny, it's just a shame that the jokey atmosphere managed to make its way into the more dramatic and poignant scenes."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,19,"Visually spectacular, action-packed, enormously entertaining, and genuinely hilarious, Thor: Ragnarok never takes itself too seriously, and therein lies its brilliance."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,20,"Ragnarok might not be the auteurist MCU film the world is (still) waiting for, but it hits a sweet spot between flashy adolescent fun and engaging characterization."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,21,"It is on-brand but full of Waititi's delightful eccentricities and gleeful exuberance. It's a joyful film to watch with something to entertain just about anyone"
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,22,"A perfect distillation of Phase 3's willingness to take what wasn't working and make it new again."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,23,Thor: Ragnarok is a blast of rock-and-roll.
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,24,"After a disappointing second venture with Thor: The Dark World, it seems Waititi has saved a superhero that was struggling to find his place in a, frankly, more interesting MCU ensemble."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,25,Waititi and his crew make some great decisions.
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,26,"The film is stylistic dynamite, and the clear ad-libbing throughout only heightens the atmosphere."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,27,"A film with beautiful visuals, impressive directing and great character dynamics, Thor Ragnarok is one of the better films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,28,"If you want to have many laughs and an unpredictable ride, it's hard to go wrong with Ragnarok and the fierce flurry of fun it provides."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,29,"Funnier and more colorful than its predecessors, this feature showcases a different side of the title character."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,30,"The first two Thor films were mediocre, forgettable affairs, but the most talented director to be given the keys to this incessantly underwhelming franchise-within-a-franchise has managed to make the biggest disappointment of them all."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,31,"Nothing short of a total crowd-pleaser with the requisite action sequences, Easter eggs and surprise appearances to keep hardcore Marvel fans excited for films yet to come."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,32,"Thor Ragnarok is entertaining and a lot of fun while watching. If it didn't have so many other superhero films to compete with, it would probably be much more memorable as a film."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,33,"Taiki Waititi inserted his skill set and unique perspective as a Maori, created a commercially viable and wildly consumable product, and made it all look easy."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,34,"Candy-colored Thor: Ragnarok is a retro, dimension-hopping hoot."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,35,"While Thor: Ragnarok is a solid 130 minutes, it feels like half that, whirring and humming along like the practiced piece of franchise machinery that it is."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,36,"A colourful, delightfully raucous cacophony of riotous belly laughs and epic set-pieces, cementing itself as one of most outrageous entries in the series so far."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,37,"It works as a great culmination of the character's story over his five appearances, but functions well enough as a standalone action sci-fi comedy in its own right."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,38,"Instead, the theme and character arc becomes about what ""saving Asgard"" actually means and what Thor's role as that savior could conceivably entail."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,39,"It's tough to hate Thor: Ragnarok, as the film is beautiful to look at and one of the funnier entries in the MCU. But it's more difficult to love it."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,40,"My only hope is that Thor: Ragnarok isn't Taika Waititi's only turn in the MCU; but if it is, he's made one of the most wildly entertaining installments in the sprawling franchise of superheroics."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,41,"This is easily the best of the three films, aided by a clever script that gives the title character a lighter side and the watchful eye of director Taika Waititi."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,42,"Which isn't to say the film isn't often genuinely funny, exciting, and entertaining. It just isn't the full-on upheaval and rebirth that a film called Ragnarok needs to be."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,43,"It's just the hit-after-hit of firecracker gags of sight and of speech undermine [Cate] Blanchett's efforts to make Hela sensual-yet-deadly, charismatic-yet-wily."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,44,"Audiences [will] get caught up in the laughter and absurdity, enjoying the ride without realizing how little is happening. Three years ago, I probably would have too."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,45,The film comes in ...as one of the strongest entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe to date. If you are in anyway a fan of the Marvel movies ... get to Thor: Ragnarok.
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,46,"Taika Waititi is rad, and this completely fun movie is evidence of that. The Hela stuff could be better, but Sakar is on-point & Jeff Goldblum is the Jeff Goldblummiest."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,47,Taika Waititi is the visionary director that Marvel needed to bring a new and better Thor to fans... This is a good thing because Thor has consistently been considered the weak link of the Avengers. Not so anymore.
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,48,"Thor: Ragnarok is a joyous continuation of that spirit, one that allows you to have fun while Thor's new squad cracks open alien heads and extended jokes."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,49,"Waititi's genius is for finding comedy gold in the little interactions between people - the misunderstandings, the callbacks, the connections, the push and pull of disparate personalities."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,50,"Ragnarok remains to keep it's level of entertainment as again Led Zeppelin is played over, highlighting each member of the Revenger team."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,51,"If you channel your goofy 8th-grade self, you will love this film."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,52,This is easily one of the best Marvel movies... Things were clicking on all cylinders.
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,53,"Thor: Ragnarok is charming, funny, visually impressive and boasts one of the more memorable villains of the MCU to date."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,54,"While I can't say that Thor: Ragnarok revives the whole superhero genre, because Wonder Woman did that earlier this year, I can say that it's a welcome addition."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,55,You can tell that everyone in the film had a lot of fun working together on the project. All of the actors just seem to be that much more charismatic on screen.
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,56,"A drastic departure from what's come before. Gone are the Shakespearean dramatics and Game of Thrones undertones, replaced instead with sleek synth riffs and the crackling energy of an '80s buddy adventure."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,57,"If your favorite part of Marvel comics was feeling that you were on a low-level acid trip, then you're going to adore this."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,58,"In fact, for all its non-stop humour, I was particularly impressed with how invested I was with the story, even if the movie at times treats it as an afterthought."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,59,... a spectacular cast and a creative freedom that impresses... [Full review in Spanish]
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,60,"It's undeniable; having Taika Waititi involved in your project will make it better."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,61,"When I saw this film prefaced by a trailer for the far glossier-looking Black Panther, it slightly felt, once Thor: Ragnarok started, that we were being palmed off with an hors d'oeuvre for the next, bigger thing down the line."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,62,"With its deft blend of humor, action, and a thrilling narrative, Thor: Ragnarok succeeds as a lighter and more memorable entry in a series that had been somewhat dominated by a darker tone."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,63,Cate Blanchett turns out to be an extraordinary Hela. [Full review in Spanish]
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,64,"It's Hemsworth who is mostly responsible for the film's tongue-in-cheek hilarity and nails its best jokes with impeccably timed deadpan aplomb."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,65,"Thor: Ragnarok is a truly rare beast, injecting a well-worn character with a new sense of life and purpose to the point that you are absolutely itching to see what's next for the Son of Odin."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,66,"This movie is so fricken fun. Thor: Ragnarock finally embraces and accepts the world that it's in."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,67,"[Taika] Waititi succeeds in making Thor both relatable and relevant, and gives us the freakiest - and one of the best - movies in Marvel's ongoing juggernaut."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,68,"The rest of this romp, however, is as light and frothy as superhero movies-or buddy comedies-come."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,69,"Right from the start, Thor: Ragnarok feels different than its predecessors (Thor and Thor: The Dark World), more comedic in tone and lighter in palette."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,70,"The movie is fun. It set out to be fun and it succeeds in being fun...if you get people to laugh at a movie, they'll probably forgive you for the tonal discrepancies."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,71,"Where does Thor: Ragnarok fit into the ever-growing ranking of the MCU? Somewhere in the middle. It's funny enough, colorful enough, and entertaining enough to strike a chord, but it's ultimately hollow."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,72,"Thor: Ragnarok may be the third stand-alone Thor movie, but it revitalizes the franchise, as well as the superhero genre, in a way that the previous chapters have not."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,73,"Some Marvel fans balk at the level of humor brought into play in the Thor trilogy, but the comedic aspects bring a fresh energy to a genre that's been overwhelmed with seemingly dozens of epics"
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,74,A good attempt to turn the solemnity of the thunder god into parody and comedy. [Full Review in Spanish]
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,75,A minor improvement over the previous installment...
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,76,"Impressively, Waititi manages to retain his unique brand of humour while fulfilling his obligations to the franchise with Thor: Ragnarok."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,77,"The movie stays fun even as the funny fades. At least it's there for 90 minutes or so, longer than usual for this often grim genre. Why so serious, indeed?"
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,78,Pleasingly ostentatious.
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,79,[Thor] is visually stunning and hysterically funny.
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,80,"Thor: Ragnarok is good. It's easily the best in the Thor trilogy - an impressive feat given that sequels often lack the spark and freshness of the original."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,81,"This is the best Thor-centric film in the Marvel universe yet, and hopefully it's a sign of more to come."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,82,"Fans won't be disappointed in Thor: Ragnorak."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,83,"After a steady decline in quality for the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Thor: Ragnarok suggests the company might have found its niche in how it presents certain characters."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,84,"Similar to how Guardians of the Galaxy is James Gunn's baby, Taika Waititi should be given the keys to Asgard and wherever Thor's adventures take him"
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,85,"A fun romp that takes us to distant worlds, inhabited by stone monsters, valkyries, gods, giants and Jeff Goldblum, who as everyone knows, is a god himself. - [Full Review in Spanish]"
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,86,"Reality is something we readily put aside when watching a Marvel outing, but ...Thor: Ragnarok is little more than a grocery store genre cake: industrial formula and A-list talent enveloped in an unnatural green screen icing."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,87,"Waititi nails the tone, visuals and action. The MCU's funniest film yet, and the best 'Thor' entry so far. [Full review in Spanish]"
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,88,"A goofy movie that feels relatively fresh, and freshness is a valuable commodity in a franchise that's now nine years and 17 movies deep."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,89,"Cate Blanchett is Marvel's new goddess and deserves her own franchise. This is the best of the Avengers and Hemsworth's charisma shines throughout, after all, he is the God of Thunder."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,90,"Thor: Ragnarok aims for laughs and maximum action-movie enjoyment, and soundly delivers."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,91,"Though it stutters in its action-heavy climax, Thor: Ragnarok is perhaps the funniest Marvel movie yet, and suggests that the studio is beginning to understand the value of letting its stars cut loose."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,92,Thor Ragnarok takes you on a visually psychedelic adventure that sadly goes absolutely nowhere.
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,93,"Beautifully filmed with serious kinetic energy by director Taika Waititi, with a crackling script, Thor: Ragnarok is a heap of fun. Cue ""Immigrant Song!"""
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,94,... fun and a good time... just ignore all the nameless characters dying horribly in the background and everything will be fine.
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,95,"It's a knowing self-spoof that doesn't take itself too seriously."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,96,"We thoroughly enjoy Cate Blanchett vamping it up as an evil villainess, glaring at us through smoky eye makeup and spitting out nasty dialogue. Like I said: Fun."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,97,"As undeniably enjoyable as it was, Thor: Ragnarok didn't feel like the latest installments of one of the MCU's central characters as much as it did a big budget spoof of a Marvel film."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,98,"With its 130 minute script that has no clue where it's going, mixed with a mash-fest of 1980's fantasy/sci-fi films we've already seen, it is an intumescent mega mess."

ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,104,"Taika Waititi, director of last year's funniest movie, now turns a Marvel sequel into a funny film. Despite the massive amount of killing, fighting and destruction in the movie, Waititi's comic touches are very evident, and effective, in this film."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,105,Thor: Ragnarok right from the outset establishes a comedic tone new to the Marvel Cinematic Universe and recasts hunky Chris Hemsworth as comic relief.
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,106,"Ragnarok is a colorful, campy sendup of the superhero genre, even as its storyline and thematic elements are decidedly morbid."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,107,"It's the funny and games between the action-sequences that fizzes and pops in what often feels like a sly remix of Flash Gordon and Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,108,"Thor's had a good run, let's get Hela lit."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,109,"""Thor: Ragnarok"" reimagines Thor as a devilishly dim hero in love with the idea of his own power until a crisis forces him to confront the notion that he's not as strong as he always figured."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,110,"Waititi doesn't so much inject humor as he gives it his own droll spin, making Thor: Ragnarok one of the funniest of the Marvel movies without seeming to exert much effort in that regard"
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,111,"Ragnarok uses quick wit to keep the comedy going, and it works really well, it's just one laugh-out-loud moment to the next, and the comedy never fails."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,112,"Beyond the movie's financial successes, the film established Hemsworth as a charming, charismatic, funny leading man, capable of carrying out director Taika Waititi's zany vision and, for the first time, making Thor a relevant Avenger."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,113,"Marvel continues to remind us that being an ethical, self-realized human is more important than being a superhuman."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,114,"It's [its] kind of self-awareness and refusal to take itself too seriously (we're looking at you, DC) that helps Marvel's shtick and comic book movies in general maintain their forward momentum."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,115,The visually dazzling and refreshingly-witty offbeat installment to the seemingly unstoppable MCU franchise proves to be a third-time charm for the charismatic hammer-loving superhero.

ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,126,"Thor still has to get his father's benediction, but Ragnarok makes mass destruction and a superhero's responsibility equal to adventure thrills and eccentric diversions."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,127,"The tone and settings are reminiscent of such watchable '80s clunkers as ""Flash Gordon"" and ""Metalstorm: The Destruction of Jared-Syn,"" with a little bit of Disney's more recent ""Maleficent"" thrown in, too."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,128,"The best silly, superhero THOR movie yet - it's thunderful!"

ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,131,"This is Asgard by way of The Comedy Store, an approach inspired not so much by previous Avengers-related entries but by Deadpool and Guardians of the Galaxy."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,132,"I can't tell why I love THOR: RAGNAROK more: Is it because it heralds the long-awaited global domination of director Taika Waititi, or simply because it's such great fun and truly one of the top Marvel movie entries? Why not both?"
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,133,"For all its brazen gags, its hip soundtrack, and its cool if somewhat hetero-normative heroes , the House That Steve Rogers Built doesn't rush headlong into truly dangerous territory."

ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,137,"The movie has a freewheeling quality that previous Thor entries lacked. Also, Jeff Goldblum gets to go 'full Goldblum.'"
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,138,"Marvel is too smart to completely undermine the serious matters at stake for its stable of characters, but confident enough to play with them a bit. Thor Ragnarok has a personality all its own, and I suspect Marvel fans will love every minute."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,139,"After the disappointments of 2011's Thor and 2013's Thor: The Dark World, something clearly needed to be done. All Waititi did was deliver Marvel's OMG-iest movie yet."

ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,148,"... in the hands of indie director Taika Waititi, who made his bones on the HBO comedy ""Flight of the Conchords,"" this is a Marvel movie as intent on busting our guts for two hours as it is on blowing stuff up."

ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,150,"Waititi seems to delight in exploring the interplay between Hemsworth's physical and comic presence. It yields a version of Thor that might annoy some comic book purists (but certainly didn't this one), but it's an undeniable asset for the franchise."

ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,155,"Altogether, Thor: Ragnarok is one of the most unique films of Marvel's now extensive lineup. It may be an unexpected combination, but this blend of star, director and style is a big winner."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,156,"It's difficult to hate any movie that allows Blanchett to chew the movie's abundant and not always impressive scenery -- archly, of course."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,157,"More Fifth Element than Avengers, more John Carpenter than Jon Favreau, Thor: Ragnarok is an often riotously entertaining interplanetary romp."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,158,"Though ""Thor: Ragnarok"" may feel like a lightweight entertainment, it comes packed with the same ingredients that made Whedon's ""The Avengers"" so good."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,159,"Chris Hemsworth releases a comic daredevil spirit comparable to that other dashing Australian swashbuckler, Errol Flynn."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,160,"This film is mediocre as a comedy, as a drama it's worse. [Full Review in Spanish]"
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,161,"Come the end of Thor: Ragnarok, you'll be shocked by just how little you actually cared throughout what just transpired."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,162,"Enjoyable and entertaining from start to finish. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Profanity, Sexual Content, etc. - also Available)"
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,163,"Still, great spectacle, and it is relentlessly . . . . what's the f-word I'm looking for?"
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,164,"The world's gone bonkers and we can all use a two-hour break, and Thor: Ragnarok is the perfect distraction."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,165,The film attempts to break new ground within the rigid confines of its genre.
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,166,"Goes all in on self-referential wackiness and an unbridled energy stream of sarcasm to unleash an apocalypse of silly, exciting fun."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,167,"There's a plot, which is almost a shame, really, since the more the film gets to indulge in offbeat characters and tangential humor, the better."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,168,Just try to resist Thor: Ragnarok. We double dog dare you.
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,169,...about half of a pretty great movie.
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,170,"There's something just a little bit off about the way the film handles its title character."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,171,"""Ragnarok"" is supposed to play for laughs, but it feels like the joke is on the audience."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,172,Thor: Ragnarok is the best Thor yet but it is still a Thor Movie.
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,173,"The laughs take center stage, but that isn't to say that the action sequences aren't thrilling. Thor's battles are epic!"
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,174,"It's fun, it's exciting, it's hilarious --- and then there's Chris Hemsworth."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,175,"We can always depend on Hemsworth's style of not taking himself too seriously, and it works well."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,176,...the first Thor movie that can take its place in the first ranks of Marvel movies.
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,177,"It's witty, it's weird and it goes against decades of bloated, overserious comics fare."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,178,"Director Taika Waititi delivers a fast paced, quip filled movie that has a rainbow of cotton candy colors and riotous set design work that still left me feeling a bit let down."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,179,"... Thor: Ragnarok proves to be so creatively loopy, not to mention so consistently hysterical, I found it hopeless not to enjoy myself while sitting in the theatre watching things play themselves out to their conclusion."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,180,Equal parts absurd and surprisingly wonderful.
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,181,"Thor: Ragnarok is the third movie in the Thor franchise, but it's the first in the series to give off the ""What, me worry?"" vibes that make the Guardians of the Galaxy movies worth the price of the admission."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,182,"Of course, you know how this ends, but the script, the cinematography, and the performances make this billionth Marvel entry seem fresh."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,183,"It is irreverent, even cheeky. It has a sense of humor about itself while never, ever making fun of comic books or their fans."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,184,"Thor: Ragnarok might rub some humorless Marvel purists the wrong way, but for the less obsessive among us, it's every bit as silly and mocking as it ought to be."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,185,"What it lacks in urgency - which is a lot, given that the story involves an extinction-level threat to Asgard and All Who Therein Dwell - it makes up for in alacrity."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,186,"The only thing I enjoyed more than the comedy in Thor: Ragnarok was a climactic battle sequence synced perfectly to Led Zeppelin's ""Immigrant Song."""
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,187,"Thor Ragnarok is, without a doubt, the best movie of the god of thunder within the MCU. [Full review in Spanish]"
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,188,"... Somehow both irreverent and respectful, and a whole lot of fun."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,189,"Sure, it's overly long, but it also features eccentric timing, shaggy humour and some hilarious new characters"
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,190,"[F]or all of its winking and joking, Thor: Ragnarok ultimately cannot escape the trap of established formula."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,191,"Director Taika Waititi's take on the God of Thunder plays a bit like the rock mockumentary This is Spinal Tap: it's front-loaded with jokes, built around a severe humbling, and full of silly bombast."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,192,"Fortunately, the charismatic Hemsworth is such good company, you're willing to play along and cruise past the roadblocks."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,193,"A comedy of outsized figures bashing at one another, punching their frenemies into the next county."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,194,Would that every superhero film had so light a touch. Not every job needs a hammer.
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,195,"Thor: Ragnarok is more fun than a barrel of winged monkeys, but man, do we have questions."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,196,"Some laughs, twists, surprises and good performances freshen up the familiar plot."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,197,"Ragnarok is a glorified commercial for next year's Avengers: Infinity War."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,198,"Thor: Ragnarok feels like a Taika Waititi movie, and a very good one - in part because however briefly, it takes the god of thunder off the perpetual-motion machine of success."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,199,"... funnier than the usual Marvel product because it's directed by Taika Waititi (What We Do in the Shadows)..."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,200,"This is a colorful mashup of Scandinavian myth, interplanetary sci-fi, Old Testament references, and crossover comic book characters."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,201,"Increasingly, it's obvious that much of the Marvel universe works best when it goes big and silly: Thor: Ragnarok is about as big and silly as a Marvel movie is ever going to get."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,202,"The intoxicatingly strange brew - the third ""Thor"" flick, and fifth Marvel film that the Norse god has appeared in - gets nicely stirred by quirky New Zealand auteur Taika Waititi..."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,203,"Most fun since Guardians of the Galaxy. Director Waititi brings the offbeat, weirdo charm of What We Do in the Shadows to Marvel."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,204,"It was only two years ago in Avengers: Age of Ultron that we started to see what a gifted comic actor Hemsworth is, so it makes eminently good sense for this entire movie to be played as a comedy."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,205,The balance of humor and action has become so one-sided that Thor: Ragnarok could use a laugh track.
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,206,"The whole cast is great. When you have Idris Elba in a relatively minor role of the all-seeing protector Heimdall, you know your ensemble is stacked."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,207,"By making Thor: Ragnarok as much a comedy as an action movie, Waititi brings some needed lightness to Marvel's storyline."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,208,"The plot is chaotic and the pacing is bizarre (scenes are unusually short and fast). But it's undeniably a riot."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,209,"[Has] a comic spin even in the action scenes... in a genre that often seems more intent on pummeling you into submission than giving you a good time, its light, breezy approach is a breath of fresh air."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,210,"At a fundamental level, Marvel jams enough high-spirited entertainment into the movie to ensure that it's worthy of the price of admission."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,211,Waititi has managed to do something with Thor: Ragnarok managed to do something with the character no director has managed to do yet: make us look forward to seeing him again.
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,212,"While Marvel movies have explored some heavier emotion, Ragnarok is the kind of roller-coaster ride I can get behind. Its exposition isn't too heavy, and it rarely goes more than a few minutes without delivering a thrill, a laugh or both."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,213,"Despite all these big personalities stuffed into a two-hour film, Thor: Ragnarok is an airtight affair that skilfully plays to each actor's strength."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,214,"Visually, Thor: Ragnarok is by far the most Jack Kirby-inspired entry in the MCU films, and thank Odin for it."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,215,Put your brain in neutral and enjoy!
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,216,"Suffice it to say, Valkyrie is a certified badass."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,217,"The Marvel Fatigue factor continues, to be sure. But hiring Waititi, and letting the right actors lean into the comedy, constitutes not a marvel, but a qualified victory."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,218,"If your goal is to spend a few hours escaping from reality, ""Thor: Ragnarok"" is definitely for you."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,219,"If Ragnarok doesn't matter in a Thor movie, what could you possibly put onscreen ever again that would matter?"
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,220,"Thor has always been the most laughable of the Avengers, and Waititi's approach means we don't have to pretend to take seriously the insane mythology about outer-space Vikings ruling over nine galactic realms."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,221,"'Thor: Ragnarok' is a wild ride, a boisterous amusement-park excursion that will divert you from beginning to end."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,222,"If ever there was a Marvel film to fly the fun flag, this is the one. Had they gone for something darker, it would have been insufferable."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,223,"Waititi reaches big, creating a cosmic odyssey that's rich with elaborate costuming, ornate sets, strange creatures, and direct danger, coming close to replicating the magic found in 1980's ""Flash Gordon."""
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,224,An absolute blast.
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,225,"As if trying to out-do Guardians of The Galaxy for wisecracks-per-minute, Thor: Ragnarok oxymoronically takes one of the most dire Norse concepts and turns it into a romp with a barrage of broad jokes and slapstick."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,226,"Tessa Thompson's badassery has jumped to new heights as her Valkyrie seems to be Marvel's answer to DC's ""Wonder Woman,"" showing (ONCE AGAIN) that women should be given their own vehicle in the MCU."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,227,Not since Iron Man 3 has a Marvel movie (mercifully) felt less like a Marvel movie.
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,228,Everything here is a goof.
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,229,"The third film about Marvel's superhero based on the Norse god of thunder shakes things up drastically, taking the series in a more colorful, more fantastic and more comedic direction."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,230,"It may sound as if the movie is only for 13-year-old boys, or the Marvel faithful, but it isn't."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,231,"It has confidence in its characters and in its own invention, and so it avoids repetition and stays fresh."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,232,"It's a thrill a minute, which is a lot of thrills for a running time of 130 minutes."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,233,"As a steady stream of random wit and bawdiness, it's a good time. But as a story ostensibly escalating toward the titular cataclysm - Norse mythology's take on doomsday - ""Ragnarok"" feels too episodic, a scattered trifle passed off as epic."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,234,"Thor has always been the most laughable of the Avengers, and Waititi's approach means we don't have to pretend to take seriously the insane mythology about outer space Vikings ruling over nine galactic realms."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,235,"Waititi creates a fun, relaxed vibe among Thor and his allies, particularly the now more articulate Hulk and the sullen, perpetually drunk Valkyrie."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,236,"About as inventive and original as one of these things can probably get away with being, before it has to go back to being the same old s--t."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,237,"Everything from the font used in the titles, to the synth-infused rock opera score by Mark Mothersbaugh, to the gloriously retro set design and visuals clearly inspired by the art of Jack Kirby, there is no Marvel movie quite like it."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,238,"Superhero fans deserve better than this. Battles should have heart, danger, and consequences. The conflicts in Thor: Ragnarok are lacking in all three."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,239,"Mr. Hemsworth looks happier and far more relaxed in ""Ragnarok"" than he did in the previous Thor vehicles, which is perhaps Mr. Waititi's truest achievement here."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,240,"I guess it's technically possible you'll see another movie this year that'll be this much fun, but I doubt it. And even if you do, it won't have Space Goldblum."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,241,The God of Thunder removes the giant hammer from his backside and drops his stodgy pretentions in favor of having a good time.
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,242,"Note to Hollywood: From now on, maybe all of our superhero franchises should be outsourced to New Zealand."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,243,"Thompson's character is as endearing as Idris Elba's is forceful. Even when Heimdall isn't on screen, his presence is very much felt as a shepherd of both the plot points and the people inhabiting Asgard."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,244,A refreshing interlude that combines creativity with an understanding of why we loved these characters in the first place.
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,245,"... seeing ""Thor: Ragnarok"" is like riding the world's fastest and tallest roller coaster that keeps looping through a funhouse."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,246,... he director has delivered possibly the most entertaining instalment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe yet.
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,247,I left Ragnarok completely happy. But I also wanted more from Hela and especially from Valkyrie.
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,248,"Taika Waititi's film is a blast even if it prizes humor above pacing and the previous movies."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,249,"The film's ability to make fun of itself is just one of the many things that make it a joy to watch."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,250,Good news everyone! That Hulk dick joke we ordered has arrived!
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,251,The film really lets Chris Hemsworth flex his comedy chops...along with his bulging muscles.
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,252,"The choice of New Zealand director Taika Waititi has created a lot of excitement for the latest installment, and while it is fun, one cannot help but feel that Marvel television writers..don't bring enough wit to the proceedings."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,253,A rollicking comedy...Waititi revs up this vehicle for a wild ride...
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,254,"The resulting superhero jaunt might not be the best movie ever produced by Marvel Studios, but it's unquestionably the most fun."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,255,"Mark Mothersbaugh (Devo) does a great job with the musical score, which includes a near-perfect placement of Led Zeppelin's 'The Immigrant Song.'"
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,256,"It may have a ways to go before it can stand on equal footing with the best Marvel films, but this was definitely a step in the right direction."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,257,"Less hammer, more humor. Ragnarok gives Thor's comic-book core a fresh, zippy new spin."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,258,Thor: Ragnarok is the flamboyantly roller-disco entry in an already uncomplicatedly cartoonish side franchise.
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,259,Marvel does not disappoint its fans. [Full Review in Spanish]
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,260,"Enormously entertaining. Witty, funny, delightfully campy, and irreverent. A great time at the movies."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,261,"None of us doubted that Cate Blanchett would make a kickass comic-book-movie villain, did we?"
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,262,"One imagines Marvel turning the keys over to director Taika Waititi and saying, ""There's a couple hundred million on the kitchen counter, have fun."""
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,263,"A funny space adventure that's weird, wild, and wonderful."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,264,The third [movie] has hit the nail on the head. [Full Review in Spanish]
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,265,"Just when you thought the MCU was out of surprises, director Taika Waititi and company deliver one of the best superhero movies of the decade."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,266,[Taika Waikiki] is able to exploit the camp or simply tacky tone that has presided over the saga of this most absurd superhero posse. [Full review in Spanish]
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,267,"From Thor and Hulk sitting on a bed talking about their feelings, to Goldblum being his most Goldblum, ""Ragnarok"" is an enjoyable break from the more ""serious"" issues explored in the MCU."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,268,"Dumb fun. But the first ""Thor"" movie to look like they threw serious money at it."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,269,May be the first Marvel movie to qualify as slaphappy.
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,270,This departure from reality and the embrace of the artistic expression make the debut of Valkyrie all the sweeter.
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,271,"""Thor: Ragnarok"" is a blast, pure and simple."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,272,"In short, Taika Waititi graduates with honors in his leap to blockbusters... [Full review in Spanish]"
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,273,"This movie is just so much fun, it's a hilarious superhero romp and nigh impossible to watch without a grin on your face."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,274,"A close-but-no-cigar film, but so enjoyable for the most part, and so modest in its aims, that its disappointments aren't devastating."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,275,"It's crazy, colorful, and without a doubt, the funniest and most fun Marvel movie. [Full review in Spanish]"
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,276,"Thor: Ragnarok may be a better comedy than epic action adventure, but it certainly makes us fall even more in love with the ""Cosmic Marvel"" universe."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,277,"It's one of the most refreshing and satisfying Marvel movies in some time, precisely because its willing to do many things that Marvel hasn't done before."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,278,"It makes an ageless space god with the nobility of King Arthur and the bodacious abs of a supermodel look like an underdog. Fallibility, not lightning, is his secret weapon."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,279,"Even for a Marvel film, Thor: Ragnarok is a weightless lark, almost to a fault. Waititi has so much fun playing with his toys that, at times, he forgets to offer the proceedings enough import. These are marginal concerns, at the end of the day."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,280,You may find yourself longing for the days when superheroes played it straight.
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,281,The film finds absurd comedy by juxtaposing the extraordinary with deliciously prosaic details.
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,282,A little light to be anything other than pleasingly disposable.
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,283,"In its own weird little way, Thor: Ragnarok manages to poke fun at the constant churn of myth and entertainment of which the movie itself is a part. It's a candy-colored cage of delights, but it is a cage nevertheless - and it doesn't hide that fact."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,284,The most riotously enjoyable Marvel movie yet.
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,285,That Ragnarok can even be in the conversation for best Marvel Cinematic Universe movie is a major victory for Marvel Studios.
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,286,"Breezy, jokey, crammed with clever sci-fi ideas; the funniest MCU flick yet. Director Taika Waititi brings a new geeky verve we didn't realize the series needed."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,287,"These Marvel sagas are insurmountably better than the relentlessly po-faced, self-important, chaotic and cruel DC movies."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,288,Thor: Ragnarok is another home run for Marvel.
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,289,"Minor quibbles aside, Thor: Ragnarok is an absolute joy."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,290,"You'll watch, be lightly amused for two hours, and go back to forgetting that Thor exists."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,291,"Even more than the Guardians films, this has the crowded, colourful, double-page-spread look of classic Marvel, with much eye-pleasing detail."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,292,"Will probably rank highly in the Marvel canon for fans, while even those somewhat worn down by the many entries will find a lot of things to like about it. A great ""soft"" reboot for the character."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,293,"Its preference for wit over CGI exhibitionism and portentous cod mythologising makes this among the best of Marvel's 17 films, and by an Asgardian country mile the funniest."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,294,"It's very silly, huge fun, and actually, in its vibrant use of colour, truer to its comic- book roots than most superhero movies."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,295,Ragnarok is unpretentious high-spirited entertainment that feels like a breath of fresh air.
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,296,"Like the antic entertainer at a children's party, director Taiki Waititi keeps us distracted with sudden noises, bright objects and silly jokes. It's not a bad plan."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,297,"Full of one-liners, bon mots and pratfalls, ""Thor: Ragnarok"" is as close as the Marvel Cinematic Universe has gotten to a full-on screwball comedy."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,298,"Waititi has not found the answers in making Thor a more exciting character, but he has found ways to go around this flaw and make his film a, sometimes, inspiring affair."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,299,"Clearly, third time is a charm for Thor as Ragnaro is the best film on the Asgardian till date, and another entry from Marvel you simply cannot miss!"
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,300,"It's no surprise the director of Boy and Hunt for the Wilderpeople could bring out a softer side to the Marvel material."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,301,"This is a perfectly balanced film, with great pacing, an engaging plot and impeccable delivery from actors and director alike. The best fun you'll have all week."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,302,"The question is: How's Marvel going to top the Waititi effect?"
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,303,"As much fun as it is, Ragnarok, by treating everything as an opportunity for a goof, forfeits any chance of taking root in your imagination. Nothing matters here."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,304,"Turns down the Shakespearean pretensions, cranks up the humor and delivers what is essentially an action-comedy with swords and capes."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,305,"The film is directed with profligate pizzazz by iconoclastic New Zealander Taika Waititi who seems to hold two fingers up to the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe, even as he caresses it with delicate affection."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,306,"... the movie is fun enough, and Waititi shows enough moxie and goofy wit throughout..."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,307,"Shot through with self-deprecating wit, slapstick (and knockabout) humour and all kinds of eccentric characters and elements, Thor: Ragnarok feels fresh, exciting and hugely entertaining."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,308,"... a superhero movie that's not afraid to be silly."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,309,... no fanatic will ask for a ticket refund from admissions. [Full review in Spanish]
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,310,"It's the first Thor movie that will make you want to see more Thor movies, because it's the first Thor movie with an idea of what makes its titular hero worth rooting for."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,311,"Thor: Ragnarok is packed tight with zooming space vehicles and noisy thunder battles, but the movie's extravagant excess is more narcotizing than energizing. Even poor Thor seems lost in all of it, and he's supposed to be its star."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,312,"Granted, there are probably more monsters and CGI battles and explosions than the movie needs. But director Waititi and star Hemsworth keep this Thor party hopping like it's 1999 and Ragnarok will never come. Good times."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,313,You could almost argue Thor: Ragnarok is too funny.
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,314,"Director Taika Waititi and his improbably buffed star Chris Hemsworth have deployed lashings of humour to grease the cogs of yet another wind-up franchise vehicle. And, to their credit, they've done a swell job."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,315,"Somewhere near the end of this made-for-the-fans installment, Cate Blanchett states, ""To be honest, I was expecting better"". I hear you, sister."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,316,Start grouchy and you may hate it. Stick a smile on your face and it will stay there.
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,317,"It's good to see Ruffalo liberated from the more masochistic portrait in Avengers: The Age of Ultron, and with a fresh partner in Tessa Thompson."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,318,"God of Thunder fights his villainous sister to defend Asgard in a splashy, joke-filled Marvel outing."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,319,"It adds up to a dense, extraordinarily funny and more-or-less non-stop great time."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,320,"The film is at its best in the brutish bromance between Thor and the Hulk as they compete for the Valkyrie's affections and the title of the strongest Avenger."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,321,"Taken on its own patchwork terms, Thor: Ragnarok is mostly diverting entertainment, though no match for what [Taika] Waititi can achieve on his own with a fraction of the budget."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,322,"Taking a character who has become embedded in the popular psyche and doing something slightly twisted with them is a good way of ensuring continuity while thumbing one's nose at the familiarity of contempt."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,323,"Taika Waititi brings to the Thor table is an ability to match laughs with some genuine heart. The film is different, it is weird, there is a lot going on, but there is also a galactic portion of fun. This could be Marvel's first cult classic."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,324,"Taika Waititi's Thor: Ragnarok is a breath of fresh air in the MCU, but still feels very much like a Marvel movie - for better or worse."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,325,"[Taika] Waititi knows exactly what his is doing, when the most grizzled, hard-drinking male figure here is female (Tessa Thompson, giving it her full Han Solo treatment)."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,326,"The God of Thunder throws more punchlines than punches in Marvel's latest."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,327,"Guardians of the Galaxy may have done it first, but Thor: Ragnarok does it best."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,328,Thor 1.0 grumbled as he saved the world; new Thor 2.0 makes small talk with a skeleton to pass the time. The latter works better.
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,329,"Full of action, laughs, and spirited fun, Thor: Ragnarok is a fine Marvel movie. But lacking a heaving heart, it's a disappointing Waititi offering."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,330,"Waititi embraces the outlandish possibilities of the Marvel universe through the costumes, torture devices and fiery demons that threaten to demolish civilisation."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,331,Epic and fun. [Full Review in Spanish]

ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,338,"It's hammer time again and Thor Ragnarok rocks with laughter put the emphasis on the ""comic"" in comic book moviemaking. The cast is up to the challenge."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,339,"I'm normally the first to moan about the awful ubiquity of the superhero genre, but when they get these things right, one has to admit they can be fun."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,340,"If you're already a fan of Waititi, Ragnarok will be like a warm bath of his particular brand of humour, but if - for some reason - you like your comic book movie homogenous, it might not be for you. But maybe try broadening your horizons, yeah?"
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,341,"Funniest Thor movie has tons of style, plenty of violence."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,342,"If the Thor films have been a bit 'meh' thus far, by allowing Waititi room to do his genuinely eccentric thing, the 17th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe might just be its best."

ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,346,"Thor: Ragnarok is an awesomely entertaining premier league win for Thor that fizzes with inventive energy. Nine years and 17 movies into the MCU, that's got to be worth some serious flagons of ale."

ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,351,"""Thor: Ragnarok"" is the most fun of the Thor movies by a long shot, but it is still very much a Thor movie for better or worse."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,352,"As awesome as Thor is, as devious as Loki is, as badass as Hulk is, Ragnarok is at its best when Valkyrie is on the screen."

ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,354,"One thing about Taika Waititi is evident: he is 100% worthy, and the power of Thor is his."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,355,"It is definitely no classic, but an appreciably looser, livelier approach will reinvigorate those beginning to tire of the standard Marvel formula."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,356,"[O]ne of the boldest and most sensuous of the MCU releases... outrageously entertaining, sure to please all ages & turn Thor into a far more popular character with mainstream audiences..."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,357,"Brighter and brasher than its predecessors, Ragnarok has that age-reversing allure that gives the same kind of high as when you first had your paws on the pages of comics way back when."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,358,"A whimsical distraction of a movie, and it's worth recommending on that level, but it clearly had the potential to be so much more."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,359,"Thor: Ragnarok plunges headfirst into unbridled comedy and Waititi gives his actors ample room to showcase their natural comedic talents, especially Hemsworth and Blanchett."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,360,"Thor: Ragnarok is the wittiest and most straightforwardly enjoyable of Marvel's blockbusters."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,361,"Thor: Ragnarok is a lot of fun, but its heart belongs to Planet Hulk and not the realm whose existence is at stake."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,362,It just might - might! - be the greatest Marvel movie.
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,363,"Both the banter and the fighting, it should be noted, are excellent, so whether you go to superhero movies for the glossy escapism or the pulse-pounding action, you'll get your large soda's worth."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,364,Taika Waititi offers Marvel majesty via Monty Python.
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,365,This film is a glorious carnival of nonsense.
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,366,"Thor: Ragnarok is fun in its own kinetic, comic book fashion but it doesn't have any dramatic urgency whatsoever."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,367,"Even tonal issues can't upend the magic this movie taps into putting Thor and Hulk together as new best buddies, whether they're throwing down in an arena or having a bromantic heart-to-heart."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,368,It basically throws up its hands at its own ridiculousness and plays it all for laughs - and it gets them.
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,369,"This is top to bottom Hemsworth's movie, and in his fifth time playing Thor, is at his very peak, and that's quite the heroic feat."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,370,"It deviates from everything it's structured the franchise to be, but it's also a perfect example of taking big risks for even bigger wins."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,371,"A film that's simply a joy to watch, with a personality that's wholly its own."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,372,"You never have to wait more than five minutes for a joke or well-placed wisecrack. Anytime there's a danger of someone giving a cliched, worthy speech about power and responsibility there's a one liner delivered like a slap to the back of the head."

ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,377,"Easily the funniest Marvel film to date, a huge achievement this far down the line and something that will have audiences crying tears of laughter."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,378,"Ragnarok is basically a Joke Delivery System - and on that score, it works. The movie is fun."
ThorRagnarok,ThorRagnarok_rm,379,"As it arrives poised for a megalithic box-office haul, it might be helpful to keep in mind the advice offered by one character: ""You cannot stop Ragnarok. Why fight it?"""
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,0,"""Wonder Woman"" is a superhero movie, and it fulfills the heroic and mythic demands of that genre, but it's also an entry in the genre of wisdom literature that shares hard-won insights and long-pondered paradoxes of the past with a sincere intimacy."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,1,"Beauty, strength, goodness, bravery: These are your values, and here is how your values must look."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,2,"Jenkins tries not only to include men on Wonder Woman's side but also to make male viewers feel better about a woman saving them."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,3,"The final big action sequence, as now seems always to be the case, is a messy and overwrought CGI extravaganza. But at least the movie that precedes it involves actual characters-likeable ones, even!-exhibiting recognizable human emotions."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,4,"Wonder Woman embraces issues of female power and the need to turn from hate to love, war to peace in a mainstream delivery system. And the female lead is not solely a mother, sister, girlfriend or hooker, however gold her heart: wonder of wonders!"
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,5,"It's overlong at 141 minutes and suffers from too much origin story exposition and middling CGI effects, but it has a frisky, friendly spirit that perfectly aligns with its wide-eyed lead actress, Gal Gadot."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,6,"For the film to reach its conclusion Diana must be confronted by the limits and power of humankind. She must understand the wonder of humanity. And for the film to work, we must be in wonder of her. And we are."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,7,"Wonder Woman is easily the best DCEU movie to date. The CGI is sub par, but is forgotten during the epic battles, and thrilling plot points."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,8,Wonder Woman is awesome and awe-inspiring. An all-round captivating piece of cinema.
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,9,"Wonder Woman may not be perfect, but it's a validation for young girls everywhere of their strength and value, and it's the first superhero film in a long time that made me look forward to a sequel."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,10,"The imperative to eradicate any hint of bossiness or anger from her character weighs heavily on the film, threatening to turn it into one long, dispiriting exercise in allaying male fears about powerful women."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,11,Congrats to Patty Jenkins and everyone involved for finally giving me a blockbuster I actually cared about! Thank you!
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,12,"Wonder Woman not only fulfils all the criteria of a superhero movie but is also engaging, exciting and inspiring throughout"

WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,14,"Some aspects of the story are also a bit over the top, but then again, it is a superhero movie. Overall, go watch it."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,15,"The opening act drags with exposition and the climax slips into the same fire and brimstone mixtape so beloved of DC. But that status also buys it an inspiring, revolutionary spirit that your average neighborhood superhero film can only dream of."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,16,"Wonder Woman is smart and engaging, funny and fun; there's far more humor and heart here than in any other DC offering."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,17,Director Patty Jenkins knocks it out of the park with this film.

WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,20,"Like Zeus breathing life into the world creating man, so does [director Patty] Jenkins breathe life into the DCEU."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,21,"It isn't groundbreaking in structure, but its exhibition of strong female heroism amidst conflicts of the past just elevates everything..."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,22,"A nuanced message of hope and mercy in a violent world? A superhero motivated by love and a desire for peace? A visionary portrayal of femininity in all its beauty, complexity, and strength? I'm with her."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,23,"This is an exciting moment for women all over the world, make no mistake. But the outdated source material hinders Wonder Woman from reaching full-out beast mode."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,24,"With the disappointment of Batman vs. Superman and Suicide Squad, DC proves they may have found their magic again."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,25,"It's not really possible to fully divorce Wonder Woman from the fact that its simple existence feels like a big, revolutionary ""event"" in and of itself."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,26,Easily joins the ranks of some of the best first outings for a superhero in the last two decades.

WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,29,Wonder Woman is not just the first great female-led superhero movie ... but an astounding example of modern blockbuster filmmaking in general.
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,30,"Wonder Woman is unmarred by the cynicism, grim and gritty attitudes, and humorless self-seriousness that have plagued the early entries in the DCEU."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,31,"Wonder Woman is not just the best film in the [DCEU] to date. It isn't just one of the best origin stories to date. It's simply one of the best superhero films made, period."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,32,It merges the best parts of Thor and Captain America into an origin story possessed with increased character complexities despite its generic plot.
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,33,"If you are still in the camp of ""DC cannot get it right"", I implore you to take a chance on Wonder Woman. Diana Prince is more than a demigod with the power to bring down the mighty. She's the hero we deserve."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,34,"The sappy romance might be a bit much for some, but there's a sense of optimism and play in Wonder Woman that feels invigorating after the dismal death wheeze of more recent DC efforts."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,35,With the film on-course for a stellar opening weekend ... the period superhero movie proves itself to be a exciting and entertaining entry to the DC cinematic universe

WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,41,"This film is very much the hero's journey, end-to-end, and it did such a good job that I forgot it was doing that. I was just lost in the story."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,42,"As a summer blockbuster with blistering action, charm to burn and plenty of potential, it's a hit."

WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,44,"Her journey in realizing that humans have a darkness and light in them is a tough lesson to learn, but her continued belief in that light is nicely done. Superhero fan or not, ""Wonder Woman"" is worth seeing."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,45,"The performances, the plot, the music, the art direction -- everything about this film is movie making at it's best."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,46,"The energy here is warm, unmistakably feminine, and the balance of light-hearted humor and melodrama sets this production apart from the somber, alpha-male brooding of its DCEU predecessors."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,47,"Bad news, haters: Wonder Woman is good."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,48,"It's told very well sans clumsy clutter and the pacing is perfect. Jenkin gets high marks for humor and for the delicate handling the romance between Gadot and the charismatic Pine who,... almost has you rooting for him to win."

WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,54,"Wonder Woman is a terrifically fun movie, deftly balancing action sequences and emotional beats. Gal Gadot is charismatic as the eponymous anti-war Amazon princess."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,55,The script by is unusually introspective
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,56,"While the future of the DCEU still remains very much in doubt, at least most will agree that the first major female-led superhero movie in years is a rousing success."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,57,Watching Wonder Woman felt like breathing out a sigh of relief.

WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,69,"I felt empowered and I'm not wonderful or a woman. You can view Wonder Woman and her first solo entry movie as a feminist icon, but honestly, it's so much more than that. She inspires us all to be more caring and better to one another"
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,70,"It's thrilling that Wonder Woman is enjoying the critical and commercial success that it is. But, in some ways it's also unfair. There is more weight than one film by one director about one woman should bear."

WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,80,A ponderous film that contains the Michael Bay esthetic beneath a thin veneer of faux feminism.
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,81,"Despite its flaws, Wonder Woman is every bit as epic as Batman v. Superman or Suicide Squad, yet has the humanity and emotion that those movies sorely lacked, despite being smaller-scaled."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,82,"It's the film that might just turn Gal Gadot into a real film star. She's touchingly good, bringing a genuine emotional depth to a part that, in others' hands, could easily have none at all."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,83,"There is great pleasure in the matter-of-fact way Jenkins and Heinberg make points about chauvinism, sexism, and equality through pointed humor and practical examples, and how deftly Diana sweeps aside all attempts by men to dismiss her."

WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,90,"The new Wonder Woman from director Patty Jenkins has an effective story, borrowing fictional archetypes while offering something original."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,91,"But this attempted revamp of the boys-club superhero genre dares to suggest that a person of conscience might put her invincible physical prowess to better use by seeking to end the carnage of warfare, not just fight to win."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,92,"Now that Wonder Woman's backstory is finally on the books, let's hope the filmmakers can come up with fresher installments in the future."

WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,102,"Gal Gadot has a talent for making every experience feel like it's her first - which, in Diana's case, it often is. She is remarkably alert. Her eyes and her face are always open; she's always receiving, learning, responding."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,103,This adaptation is very exciting.
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,104,"Our heroine leaps through the air, spinning like an arrow, but the action has so little weight, emotional or otherwise, that one feels nothing."

WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,116,"The film is full of ""you go, girl"" moments designed to please the genre's long-neglected female demographic. Yet Diana seems far more confident than the film's director, Patty Jenkins...as a narrative the film is over the shop."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,117,"'Wonder Woman' is good, but not as much as I expected after so much praise. Maybe that's why I've focused more on its weak points when the truth is that I came out quite satisfied to see it. [Full review in Spanish]"

WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,125,"One of the few superhero movies to pass the Bechdel test with flying, bullet-deflecting wrist bracelets."

WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,135,"Here, DC gets its first good movie. Jenkins has come up with a star that can hold the attention of the audience better than any superman stuffed with steroids. [Full review in Spanish]"
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,136,"In short, Wonder Woman is a wonder."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,137,"Jenkins rises above the pressure and brings a solid, interesting and humorous story to life. Wonder Woman brings light to the darkness of the DCEU, literally and figuratively."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,138,Gadot and Pine [mine] their characters for the kinds of small but meaningful moments that most superhero movies would kill for.
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,139,I love her. I love her so much.
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,140,"For Wonder Woman girls can cheer without feeling a hint of fear. And guys can also shout'Hooray' when Wonder Woman saves the day!"
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,141,Wonder Woman is a perfect reflex of its time. [Full review in Portuguese.]
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,142,"As Wonder Woman, Gal Gadot cuts an iconic figure throughout, each purposeful stride a symbol in motion."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,143,"Gadot carries the movie by combining the charisma of a demigod with the personability of Indiana Jones; even when she's fiercest, empathy and humor are never far away."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,144,"A long, long overdue movie, given our taste for superheroics, Wonder Woman deserves to be a hit. All the things that go right here overwhelm the few that don't."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,145,Just fantastic from top to bottom...
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,146,"Although the film follows a somewhat traditional script, it also deviates -- because superheroing while female is a radical act."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,147,"A movie with a good romantic rapport by Gadot and Pine, a solid secondary cast and a dramatic idea contained in Allan Heinberg's script. [Full review in Spanish]"
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,148,"Patty Jenkins brings a refreshing clarity to [Wonder Woman], a productive mix of gravitas and winking."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,149,"There are too many villains, none of them dramatically strong enough to be much of a threat, and the most interesting characters get killed off too soon."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,150,"This is a proper introduction to a superhero who was brought on so lamely in Batman vs. Superman, and the good outweighs the bad here, on balance."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,151,"The film is successful for what it is because it's directed by a woman. It's worth considering the nuclear-grade disaster this could have been with a guy at the helm."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,152,"Everything about this joyful, sincere origin story feels like a retort - a very welcome and much needed one - to traditional male-centered superhero stories."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,153,"From the powerful confidence of [Gadot's] action scenes to moments of emotion and comic relief, it's already near impossible to imagine anyone else in this role."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,154,"Gadot's Princess Diana is the full nascent-superhero package: youthful idealism, a body so perfect you'd swear it was a special effect, and some mystical backstory for a third-act revelation."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,155,"The action is solid enough and the effects, of course, are impressive, but the [Wonder Woman] lacks imagination."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,156,This elaborate and expensive epic is worth it for star Gadot.
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,157,"By the time we reach the Western Front with Trevor's rag-tag secret agent squad, Patty Jenkins has so deftly juggled period rom-com and epic fantasy elements that even trench warfare barely dampens the momentum."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,158,"With strong characterisation from a largely committed cast, coherent action and a rare confidence in its mise-en-scène, Wonder Woman is a comic book movie the way they should be done."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,159,"Wonder Woman provides an example of female power that the world needs. Both girls and boys need to see women on-screen just as powerful, if not more powerful than men."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,160,"Wonder Woman has come to save us from ourselves in her long, long, long overdue cinematic debut. And in the best news of all, the wait was worth it."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,161,"Wonder Woman is a positive symbol, but the ideology of the movie itself is fuzzy and somewhat disappointing."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,162,"""Wonder Woman"" is a great action movie, full of adventure and light drama, similar to films like Christopher Reeve's ""Superman"". [Full review in Spanish]"
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,163,"Top action choreography, a fine cast and a side order of fish-out-of-water camp that director Patty Jenkins serves next to wartime derring-do and Diana's gritty grace is why it succeeds."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,164,An elegant but intellectually timid film.
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,165,"Jenkins and screenwriter Allan Heinberg have created an unassailable icon, one who fits into the pantheon with ease, and stands out like no other."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,166,DC finally breaks its long losing streak with a satisfying effort- and all it took was changing absolutely everything (Splice Today)
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,167,"Wonder Woman doesn't walk away from her first film unscathed, but Jenkins mostly gets it right, focusing on grandeur, virtue, and sheer butt-kicking excellence, supporting a hero who's truly heroic."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,168,"Wonder Woman is a damned good superhero movie, because it remembers to just be a damned good movie."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,169,"Here, in her own surroundings -- and playing with contrivances that include the character's magic bracelets and Lasso of Truth -- Gadot truly appears to be a legitimate movie wonder."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,170,"Unlike most silly fantasy superhero movies, this one is not set in a fictional locale with fictional characters. No, it's Wonder Woman winning WWI! It is the same intellectual diarrhea of all the others, only worse, minimizing the horrors of WWI."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,171,"What stands as the film's most surprising revelation is how timely ""Wonder Woman"" feels at moments when approaching themes of war and human kind. It taps into a sensitive spot that speaks volumes today."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,172,"""Wonder Woman"" gracefully ascends into the arena and defiantly delivers a stylish, funny adventure made with heart. After the genre shaking ""Logan"" and the genre redefining ""Wonder Woman,"" there's only one thing left to be said: your move Marvel."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,173,"A superhero origin story infused with the spirit of feminist adventure, and told with smarts, heart, and a different point-of-view."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,174,"No matter how the ""fairy tale"" really happened. Some unknown named Gal Gadot was chosen for instant stardom. And she deserves it! Director Patty Jenkins was finally released from Hollywood jail."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,175,This Wonder Woman will be inspirational to a new generation of young girls looking for a role model who is both physically strong and endlessly compassionate at the same time.
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,176,...smartly feminist without making too big of a deal out of it.
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,177,"After the offensively stupid Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and Suicide Squad, Wonder Woman feels nothing short of revelatory."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,178,"In common with Diana, there is a genuine wonder at work here. We rediscover the tropes of genre through her questioning eyes. And for once, the comic-book movie almost seems fresh again."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,179,"Wonder Woman's relative innocence and absolute conviction make for an endearing and formidable hero."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,180,"Wonder Woman is a very likable movie. But it was also a very likable movie when Marvel made its kissing cousin, Captain America: The First Avenger."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,181,Wonder Woman is the right movie at the right time -- and for all the right reasons.
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,182,Loved Gadot. The script and supporting actors/characters not so much.
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,183,"Wonder Woman is the most refreshing comic book movie in years, if not ever. Smart, witty , fun and Gal Gadot shines along with Chris Pine."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,184,"As a period piece made in the spirit of an old-fashioned matinee, Wonder Woman (like the first Captain America) does not have to exhibit the insistent, grim-faced dystopianism that afflicts the recent Superman/Batman movies."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,185,"To be honest, the fight scenes go on too long and the CGI is laid on a bit thick. It isn't necessary. Gadot's magnificent heroine is enough of a wonder woman in her own right not to need it."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,186,Visually dazzling pop culture superhero movie.
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,187,"It only took two women to right a ship that dozens of male D.C. executives, writers and directors, have tried their damnedest to sink."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,188,Jenkins and company understand superheroes should have a purpose other than brooding.
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,189,"The beautiful message of Wonder Woman is that attributes commonly associated with women - compassion, empathy, and protectiveness - are the most awesome superpowers of all."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,190,"While the film descends into the usual pyrotechnical showdown late on, it's watchable, well made and not excessively violent overall, which should make it suitable for older children."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,191,"Finally, DC got it right -- Wonder Woman is a thrill ride that's entertaining from beginning to end."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,192,"[It's] surprising to watch the dynamic shift in performance she delivers throughout the film, as the naive and optimistic Diana is slowly faced with the undeniable darkness in mankind. Perhaps most importantly, Gadot is also [funny]."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,193,"Wonder Woman does something special: It gets real. In a genre sometimes overly fond of black-and-white heroes and villains, this film forces its heroine to confront moral grays."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,194,"After her long struggle to the big screen, Wonder Woman makes the most of her first solo effort."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,195,"is wondrous -- an origin story about a superhero not driven by loss and vengeance but an innate sense of what's right."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,196,"It has some resemblance to Captain America: The First Avenger (2011), but Jenkins doesn't fall into the propagandistic discourse of saving America, but focuses on nurturing, humanizing and affirming the leadership of his heroine. [Full review in Spanish]"
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,197,"A[n] armoured shoe-in for the most pleasantly stunning feature of the summer (or year for that matter), Wonder Woman is everything you could have ever expected from a Wonder Woman movie."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,198,Invests Princess Diana with possibly the most genuinely heroic characterization of any modern cinematic superhero.
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,199,"An entertaining film with a more sincere, heartfelt and sympathetic energy than its peers - of the best that DC has created in its bewildering attempts to imitate the Marvel model. [Full review in Spanish]"
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,200,"It's no small relief that 'Wonder Woman' is a decent piece of pop art, messy and unsuccessful in spots, yes, but engaging nonetheless, and an almost incalculable improvement on its predecessors in the ""DC Extended Universe."""
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,201,"Sorry boys. Wonder Woman is the hero the DC universe deserves, and the one it should believe in."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,202,"Wonder Woman is a great yarn, done very well."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,203,"I've got no subtweet with Wonder Woman, ninety percent of its running time being nothing less than sharp moviemaking. Yet the true and lasting fun will be to witness its eddying cultural influence upon younger generation"
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,204,Wonder Woman gives this long-ignored heroine the coming-out party she truly deserves.
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,205,"With a story that moves at a steady clip and action that threads the needle between realism and supernatural exaggeration, Wonder Woman is the arrival of a hero for all of us, but young women in particular."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,206,"Boldly optimistic, this action-packed adventure breathes fresh life into the DC universe with a welcome balance of comedy, flirtation and a sense of righteous justice."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,207,"It's impossible to imagine a better Diana Prince/Wonder Woman than Gal Gadot in Patty Jenkins' lively Wonder Woman."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,208,"Wonder Woman is a great movie by any measure, but it's at its best when it embraces and embodies the universe-defying potential inside the heart of every little girl."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,209,"Wonder Woman downplays Diana's pursuit of destiny in the fight against evil...Diana, like her introductory movie, has childlike enthusiasm but no passion."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,210,"Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman gets a chance to shine in her own Hollywood movie. Gadot makes a pretty fine job of it too, bringing a bit of soul and empathy to the proceedings, but sometimes it's more despite than because of the production surrounding her."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,211,"The film puts in much simpler words the human and feminine (even feminist) discourse already seen in The Force Awakens with Rey, who, like Diana, has to sacrifice, fight and learn before reaching the final goal. [Full review in Spanish]"
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,212,"Jenkins delivers Wonder Woman's origin story and although it's uneven and overlong it finds humor, humanity, and an appealingly old school sense of honor in its title character."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,213,"If Wonder Woman is a sign of what is to come from DC, it's a very good sign."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,214,"The action is crisp and thrilling, but more importantly, it's meaningful... In fierceness and sheer badass fighting prowess, Wonder Woman is a match for the other heroes in her franchise. But in courage and certainty, she tops all of them."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,215,"A satisfying and heroic film that doesn't pretend or prove to be anything more. [Full review in Spanish]"
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,216,"Thanks to Gal Gadot's truly wonderful breakout performance and Patty Jenkins' robust direction, Wonder Woman proves worth the wait."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,217,"Jenkins delivers a superhero movie that's better than those helmed by her male predecessors who weren't Richard Donner or Christopher Nolan."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,218,"From start to finish, Wonder Woman is an origin story that is faithful, thoughtful, and streaked with exciting action and impressive stunts."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,219,"I was waiting for Gadot. Now that she's arrived, she was all the Gal I could have hoped for... Jenkins creates a hero who loves without fear. She understands the difference between Wonder Woman and the spandex heap of extraordinary others."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,220,"""A trailblazer and a gamechanger."""
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,221,"Have no doubt, this movie does Wonder Woman justice, as well as her fans."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,222,"Wonder Woman has what many other action films (and superhero films) are missing: talented, chemistry-cast leads; exciting action; and thrilling villains to antagonise our heroes."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,223,"If you can forgive the ending, like I have, and love Diana for her inspiring character, the righteousness of her spirit and also the mad slo-mo action, this film will lasso you right in."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,224,"Smart, funny and tremendously exciting."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,225,"Patty Jenkins... working from a surprisingly deft script from Allan Heinberg, has gone and given us a Wonder Woman with a lot more than WW's bulletproof forearm bracelets on its sleeve."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,226,"Engaging, entertaining, empowering superhero adventure."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,227,"It means so much, especially in today's world, to watch a woman who is allowed to be naïve, curious, sensitive, and strong save the day."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,228,"It's disappointing because Wonder Woman deserves better."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,229,"""Wonder Woman"" is a thing of hope and beauty; it'll give you a lump in your throat and make you want to cheer."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,230,"It's a great superhero movie by any yardstick. But, more significantly, it's a great Wonder Woman movie, capturing the compassion and optimism that sets her apart from her brooding fellow SuperFriends."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,231,Gadot is a gift to a genre that was long past the point of beginning to feel seriously depleted.
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,232,"While it is not the best superhero movie I've ever seen, it's one I wish had been around when I was a young comic book nerd, and one I hope every girl, nerdy or not, gets to see."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,233,"Gadot is hugely appealing in the role. She and Jenkins have leaned toward Christopher Reeve's first Superman as a model for how to play the role: strong but innocent, a fish out of water."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,234,"Many big ideas are juggled, and while the story doesn't exactly drop them, it does flail about a bit. Still, Jenkins has an eye for moving moments, Gadot is great fun to watch, and there's genuine visual panache to be found amid the combat and comedy."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,235,"This is the first DC Comics movie that mostly has the look, feel and energetic aura of a Marvel film. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Profanity, Sexual Content, etc. - also Available)"
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,236,Wonder Woman is a different kind of superhero film.
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,237,"Wonder Woman is a fresh, invigorating entry into the superhero film genre that finally lets a woman take center stage-and the results are excellent."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,238,"Gadot radiates the goodness without sentimentality or wide-eyed winsomeness. Supergirl she ain't. SuperGal she certainly is."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,239,"The real strengths of this production are its lead actors, the period piece setting, and an unexpected emotional resonance that one doesn't expect from a popcorn movie."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,240,"When 'Wonder Woman' is good, it is compellingly fun. But when the Amazonian warrior is shown for the 37th time in mid-air, slo-mo battle pose, it is a yawner."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,241,"The most fun I've had at the theater so far this year."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,242,"Don't be fooled. ""Wonder Woman"" may look like just another superhero movie --- but it's not. It's a tour-de-force by Gadot, not to be taken lightly."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,243,"Gadot more than lives up to the challenge, and is as good at delivering her lines as she is handling a magical lariat."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,244,"Enthralling, suspenseful, thrilling and refreshingly witty. A much-needed breath of fresh air. Bravo to Patty Jenkins! Note to Hollywood: please hire more women to direct blockbusters."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,245,"In a movie filled with striking imagery and visual effects, one of the most empowering shots is of Diana emerging out of the trenches, ready to fulfill her destiny and rewrite received Hollywood wisdom on a woman's place in the movies in the process."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,246,"Gadot's contribution to the film cannot be understated. She brings a sense of innocence and conviction to the role that's reminiscent of Christopher Reeve's approach to the Man of Steel in ""Superman: The Movie."""
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,247,"Wonder Woman is funny, exciting and fun, but more importantly, it's touching and inspiring. [Full review in Spanish]"
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,248,"Within its clichés and action sequences with inexplicably outdated effects, the film tells a solid story of maturity. [Full review in Spanish]"
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,249,"I have missed heroism in the big screen like Patty Jenkins and Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman. Pure, without cynicism nor sarcasm, full of goodness, wanting to do the right thing. [Full review in Spanish]"
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,250,The only wonder regarding this movie is that it could be so incredibly dull. I keep hoping DC will find a key to unlock the magic inherent in its great cast of characters.
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,251,"Wonder Woman, director Patty Jenkins' immensely satisfying origin story of the Greek Amazon warrior reared on a mist-shrouded isle, boasts the nonchalant humor and heroics, if not the breakneck pace, of Raiders of the Lost Ark."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,252,"Gadot does succeed, against heavy odds, in creating a fresh figure of heroic morality and might, engaging an audience with an earnest character's discovery of herself and the world."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,253,"Wonder Woman has action, humor and heart, as well as strong performances across the board, especially from Gadot and Pine."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,254,"There is an engaging, old‑school feel to Wonder Woman, a film that has some of the sincerity and charm of the early Christopher Reeve Superman epics."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,255,Patty Jenkins proves what a talented director can do with a superhero movie. She and Gadot also contribute touches that only women can.
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,256,"An origins story that's earnest yet fun and exciting without being grandiose."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,257,"Gadot ... exudes superhero charisma, which powers her through a clichéd last chapter."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,258,"The balance is tipped toward the positive by the fact that the plot rattles along merrily, taking us from the wilds of Themyscira (Paradise Island for us old-timers) to wartime London, the trenches of Europe and more."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,259,"It's a bird ... it's a plane ... it's a DC movie that doesn't crush your soul."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,260,"Wonder Woman might not be the greatest thing ever, but it is a damn fine film, and full admission: I spent a good chunk of it honest-to-God misty eyed."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,261,"What makes Wonder Woman work so well is the character of Diana herself, who's written and performed with the kind of emotional intelligence that's rare in these kinds of films."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,262,"Suffering Sappho! Patty Jenkins' ""Wonder Woman"" is that rarity: a superhero movie with a heart."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,263,Gal power whips up a roaring adventure.
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,264,Gadot and Jenkins convey a much-needed sense of excitement and adventure to a group of movies that seemed to be suffocating on their own gravitas.
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,265,Wonder Woman is a cut above nearly all the superhero movies that have been trotted out over the past few summers.
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,266,"Remember when superhero movies were fun? ""Wonder Woman"" does."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,267,"Except for the title, Patty Jenkins's big-hearted blockbuster doesn't use the name Wonder Woman. Wonder Woman is singular. Wonderful women are manifold, and hopefully they'll fill theaters alongside some wonderful men"
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,268,"This is a movie about battling evil that pauses to ask what evil is and whether it's necessary to understand its nature in order to defeat it."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,269,"The film's strengths far outweigh its flaws, combining moral and emotional authenticity with superhuman stunts and a lively sense of fun: everything you want from a PG-13 superhero movie. It also feels undeniably fresh."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,270,"There's so much to like about Patty Jenkins' long-awaited Wonder Woman that I understand those who've gone off the deep end praising it."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,271,"So when are Jenkins and Gadot teaming up for the next installment? We can't wait."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,272,"Filled with the kind of humor and earnestness that [the last couple DC films] were criticized for lacking, Wonder Woman is an absolute joy to watch, thanks in large part to its two leads."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,273,"Wonder Woman succeeds because it understands the character. Not only that, it lets her shine in an origin story that may hit familiar beats at times, but is driven by great character work, a clever script and two great leading performances."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,274,Finally.
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,275,"Powerful, empowered and driven by purpose, Wonder Woman is the superhero movie we need right now. It's also a blast of summer-movie entertainment that should charm fangirls and fanboys alike -- along with anyone who likes having a good time."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,276,"In a world of comic-book movies populated with sarcastic, jokey superheroes dropping witty one-liners with every move, Wonder Woman is a blast of fresh air -- an earnestly heroic character bringing goodness and love to a violence-ravaged world."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,277,This latest entry into the DC Comics world is only partially successful before eventually succumbing to genre fatigue.
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,278,"The character of Wonder Woman enters the almost exclusively male domain of DC comics movies... Under this pressure, Jenkins comes through with a work that radiates confidence and sangfroid."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,279,"Fuel up the Invisible Jet. You're in for a ride."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,280,"We can overlook how the third act yields to the blows-up-good formula of blockbuster franchises. For now, let's just celebrate a superhero movie that runs on estrogen rather than testosterone."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,281,"The real success of the film is that Gadot is perhaps the cinema's best-cast DC-style aspirational superhero since Christopher Reeve's Superman."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,282,"The moviegoing world deserves the best that Hollywood can deliver, and this time we've pretty much got it."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,283,"Unlike Batman v Superman or Suicide Squad, Jenkins' film isn't about the heroes beating the villains - it's about the humanity of its eponymous heroine."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,284,"Much credit should go to Godot, who can be alluring, tough, goofy and sweet all in the same take."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,285,What makes this a must see for fans of superhero movies is the performance of Israeli actress Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman. This is a star-making turn...
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,286,"Wonder Woman is good. Not great, but good. And really, after Man Of Steel, Batman V Superman: Dawn Of Justice and Suicide Squad, that's all it needs to be."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,287,"It's so great to see a film pay off in a way that will please both its hardcore fans and a general public that has been clamoring for it for decades."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,288,The best DC film since The Dark Knight.
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,289,"The movie does drag a bit during that midsection after Diana bids farewell to the Amazons, but it's consistently entertaining, buoyed in no small part by [Gadot's] presence, which makes the mythological seem possible."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,290,"The cinematic universe of DC Comics finally hits all the right notes -- bullets, bronze, and mustard gas included -- in what for any other superhero would be a distinctly Marvel origin story."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,291,"[A] torpid, overlong DC Comics epic ... puts the first world war on a baking tray for the latest cook-till-crisp superhero flick."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,292,"This film makes the character one of the more engaging, empowered, and empowering of the recent crop of super-powered heroes. It's a pretty good movie, too."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,293,"Gadot proves she is worthy of Wonder Woman's tiara, but the superhero deserves a great film, not one that's just better than the others."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,294,"The only grace note in the generally clunky Wonder Woman is its star, the five-foot-ten-inch Israeli actress and model Gal Gadot, who is somehow the perfect blend of superbabe-in-the-woods innocence and mouthiness."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,295,"Hopeful, empowering, and enormously entertaining, Warner Bros. Pictures' Wonder Woman is the feature film this iconic female superhero deserves."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,296,"Even in its weaker moments, Wonder Woman honors the scale of a superhero who stands alongside Superman and Batman in the DC lexicon, but has never had a vehicle worthy of her."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,297,"For roughly half of its nearly two-and-a-half-hour running time, 'Wonder Woman' is a better-than-average superhero movie; a pity it falls off so precipitously in the last act."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,298,"A Wonder Woman film that is inspiring, hopeful, blistering, and compassionate, in ways that honor what has made this character an icon."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,299,"She's fearless, whip-smart and she's just saved the Universe. After three false starts, director Patty Jenkins has delivered the first great film in the DCEU."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,300,"Taken just at face value as a superhero movie, Wonder Woman is one of the best in its class, matching some of the better efforts in a genre that Marvel has dominated for years."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,301,"Never reinvents the superhero origin story, but it hits all the familiar beats with enthusiasm and style."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,302,"Wonder Woman is grandly entertaining, offering up a hero whose sincerity reveals a sense of decency and self-sacrifice our modern world could use to learn a little from."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,303,"An enjoyable adventure because of its two strong leads, its effortless tonal shifts and its aversion to narrative traps."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,304,"Wonder Woman is easily one of DC's best movies, but it also belongs in the conversation of best comic book origin movies period."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,305,"It's a winner! Every bit the Amazonian warrior princess, Gal Gadot leaps onto the screen in a smartly written girls' own superhero adventure with an appealing mix of action, romance, humour and spectacular effects."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,306,"At long last: we can rank a DCEU superhero movie over some of the best the MCU has to offer... and actually mean it. Here's all you need to know: Gal Gadot IS Wonder Woman."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,307,She does not disappoint.
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,308,Wonder Woman is glorious.
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,309,"Unlike lots of comic book movies, it feels like a work of passion and vision. I sense a filmmaker behind it, not a focus group."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,310,"""Wonder Woman"" has raised the bar. Now let's see if the boys can clear it."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,311,"What lingers ... is the feeling of hope that the movie brings, that it someday might be possible for female rationality to defeat male brutality."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,312,Any hopes that Wonder Woman will sustain its appealing misandry are soon dashed.
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,313,Your daughters should love it -- and so should your sons.
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,314,"The film effortlessly streamlines decades of comic book history that blends the DC Universe and Greek mythology, telling the origin of the mysterious, ageless Wonder Woman who stole the show in Batman v Superman."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,315,"Jenkins has succeeded where DC had thus far failed, and in that sense, Wonder Woman should be (and is being) hailed as a triumph."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,316,"Director Patty Jenkins and her collaborators have taken the well-worn superhero origin story and invested it with a rich, sometimes revelatory depth of feeling."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,317,"The best thing about Wonder Woman, the overlong and intermittently enjoyable new DC superhero spectacular, is Wonder Woman herself."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,318,"Every DC Universe movie so far has juggled themes of love versus duty...But Wonder Woman is the first to suggest that love IS duty; if you love at all, you must fight to preserve that in the world."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,319,"Gal Gadot's performance has the poise and humor that conjures up memories of Christopher Reeve."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,320,"'Wonder Woman' falls victim to over reliance on computer graphics and it's too long. But that's counterbalanced by a story grounded in real emotions and characters who inhabit a three-dimensional world, albeit a comic-book-inspired, fantastical one."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,321,... the lone DC Comics project this century not directed by Christopher Nolan that delivers on its advance expectations.
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,322,"Not just one of the better origin stories but one of the most hopeful, positive superhero movies we've seen in a while."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,323,"Throughout Wonder Woman there is an earnestness in tone that plays well, and rarely as saccharine."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,324,This picture tries so hard to avoid making a statement that it becomes the elephant in the room.
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,325,"Director Patty Jenkins displays a deft hand contrasting the gentle beauty of Wonder Woman's paradise island with the horror of the First World War. Her movie is mesmerizing, as she allows the audience to see the world through alien eyes."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,326,"Wonder Woman gives rising star Gal Gadot the chance to... demonstrate her impressive skill set that includes a nuanced sense of humor, heightened physicality, dramatic gravitas and charismatic self-confidence."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,327,To say Wonder Woman is a breath of fresh air would be an understatement to this purely joyful and vibrant ride of a story.
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,328,"Get ready for Gal Gadot to become etched in the pop culture pantheon of strong women who can kick some butt, slay a few stereotypes and own a movie."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,329,"[Gadot] seems born to play the part. Her ragtag band of sidekicks are a huge breath of fresh air next to the usual super-hero super-groups we're accustomed to."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,330,"Wonder Woman is a fun superhero movie that's well worth checking out on the big screen."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,331,"The moral of the story, children, is that the world, of superheroes and mere mortals alike, is all the more better when there are more women around."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,332,"The major problem is its marathon duration of 140 minutes, way too long for a blockbuster noticeably bereft of sustained wow-factor spectacle."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,333,"Jenkins and Gadot did their level best to give us, within the confines of an unforgiving superhero universe, the Amazing Amazon that fans deserve."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,334,"Wonder Woman is a strong, at times even rousing, application of the superhero film formula, but it ultimately can't transcend the constraints of the genre."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,335,"Commanding and clear of vision, all the more electrifying because the time is taken to get to know, to understand, and to care about the people onscreen. Imagine that."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,336,"Jenkins doesn't need to bludgeon us with pyrotechnics. The real fireworks of the ""Wonder Woman"" narrative are its powerful emotions."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,337,"Wonder Woman is a top-notch blockbuster, fun and fast and carrying quite a lot of the thematic heft that characterizes the dramatic ambition of the better DC Comics movies as against the more light-hearted Marvel efforts."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,338,"I blanched slightly at Wonder Woman's almost two-and-a-half-hour running time, but the film raced by -- perhaps because every cliché was subverted by the freshness of a female lead."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,339,Patty Jenkins and Gal Gadot deliver in Wonder Woman the necessary superhero movie these days. [Full review in Spanish]
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,340,Wonder Woman is spectacular.
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,341,"A smart, exciting, politically aware origin story."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,342,"...an old fashioned super hero movie. There's nothing wrong with that, of course, but I don't think my strongest impression was supposed to be 'Robin Wright really kicks ass.'"
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,343,"I have to admit, my heart soared. Wham, bam, thank you ma'am."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,344,"What's best about the film can be summed up in two words: Gal Gadot."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,345,"It feels less like yet another installment in an endless sequence of apocalyptic merchandising opportunities than like ... what's the word I'm looking for? A movie. A pretty good one, too."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,346,"Wonder Woman walks a different path. Her arc in the movie isn't discovering she has powers or that those powers demand responsibility. Her arc is showing that humanity, as deeply flawed as it is, is worth saving."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,347,"A sturdy origin story, this education of Miss Diana Prince, establishing her as a compassionate badass who consistently proves her bravery, strength, and commitment to justice."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,348,"Wonder Woman may be a step in the right direction when it comes to getting the DCEU on track, but it still falters in too many places to get itself up to an acceptable level."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,349,"The first film of the DC Extended Universe that doesn't seem embarrassed by its premise."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,350,"Far from flawless, but 'Wonder Woman' is arguably the best DC comic book film since 'The Dark Knight.' So, bow down to the Princess."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,351,"A rousing adventure yarn, shorn of the usual fanboy mythos."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,352,"Wonder Woman more than shoulders the weight of our expectations, and dazzles us with brilliant kick-ass action and *shocker* heart that her male counterparts couldn't hope to match."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,353,"Jenkins (and Gadot) particularly excel in the action scenes, because when Wonder Woman first runs across the battlefields in her costume, you are immediately won over."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,354,A silly and derivative genre picture that lightly carries an empowering feminist topicality
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,355,"The film's two major strengths come down to the two most important ingredients - cast and story."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,356,"It's much, much better and more thoughtful than [other superhero films]; its depiction of heroism and humanity, more complex. Most importantly, it's a great time at the movies. More like this, please."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,357,"There are some moments of bold storytelling, and the focus on humanity, morality and love is an unusual and welcome theme in a superhero movie. (But don't worry, it's not all moralising - Diana still punches a lot of people.)"
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,358,Wonder Woman is a game changer because it is not only the best film of the DCEU but one of the best superhero films ever made.
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,359,"Witnessing such feminine power is mind-boggling and awe-inspiring, but wistful, too. It's a shame that such instances are so rare to be exceptional."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,360,"With its nods to Richard Donner's Superman and Chris Evans' first outing as Captain America, Wonder Woman also exceeds expectations as an origin story with its First World War setting."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,361,"For all of Wonder Woman's nifty weapons, the one that proves most indispensable is her chemistry with Chris Pine's ultra-charismatic American spy Steve Trevor."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,362,"Patty Jenkins' Wonder Woman is so super, you could almost forget how important it is. But I hope you don't."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,363,"Wonder Woman has turned out better than the cynics expected, and has plenty of what fans were hoping for."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,364,Her sincerity and compassion are her greatest super powers of all.
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,365,"It's an interesting take both on Wonder Woman and the genre in general, but as so many films like this do, it can't escape the siren pull of Big Dumb Action, with a CGI-laden climax that could be from any movie, so generic is the battle."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,366,"When Diana DOES spring into action, Wonder Woman rocks. It's as if we're learning exactly what she's capable of at the same time Diana is discovering the depths of her powers."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,367,"Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman was the best thing about the swampy Batman v Superman, and now her solo outing is the far superior film: Wonder Woman, directed by Patty Jenkins, elevates her from third wheel to real deal."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,368,Gal Gadot is unstoppable and spectacular to see in motion. Watch her fly.
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,369,"Gadot plays Diana in appealing fashion. For all her strength and prowess, she is an innocent, even comic figure, who simply can't understand the cynicism, politicking, and violence of the humans she encounters."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,370,"Director Patty Jenkins's fight scenes are masterpieces of motion. Gal Gadot is majestic. Chris Pine is impossibly charming. And Jenkins has created a film that rightfully does justice to its legendary title character."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,371,"This is a moment 75 years in the making where the hopes and dreams of millions of little girls and adult women finally crystallize into one transcendent image that is proud, defiant, and a long time coming."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,372,Wonder Woman is a decent but bland addition to the genre that truly shines only in comparison to the rotten DCEU movies so far.
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,373,"A rollicking action adventure in the tradition of 'Indiana Jones', with a fully functioning sense of humour and the year's most lip-smackingly evil baddie."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,374,Welcome relief from the predictable skyscraper-levelling of the contemporary superhero adventure.
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,375,"Wonder Woman is a winner, an immersive origin story with unexpected humor and epic action scenes. Gal Gadot proves she has the right stuff, every bit the feminist icon and hero fans deserve."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,376,"Entertaining and empowering, it's the best in DC's Extended Universe. Physically perfect, Gal Gadot is strong & sexy, statuesque & stunning."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,377,"[A]n electrifying, breathtaking cinematic achievement... Amazing performances, pulse-pounding action, and outstanding visuals make it one of the best superhero movies of all time."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,378,"The DCEU's game gets raised. Gadot is a godsend, Pine charms, and Jenkins delivers old-school thrills with heart and conviction."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,379,"You won't be disappointed in the slightest."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,380,"When it does get down to superheroine business, this latest DC Comics 'extended universe' outing packs a decent punch and, in Israeli model Gal Gadot, introduces a star with real franchise potential."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,381,"Despite lulls in the overall narrative energy, there are real stakes and sacrifice, along with genuine heart and humor in this welcomely uncluttered tale."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,382,Gadot turns out to be as perfect a fit for the iconic character as Christopher Reeve was for the Man of Steel.
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,383,"It has a considerable amount of humor, which may not cause you to laugh out loud but sometimes triggers a smile. If it's possible to describe a superhero film as likeable, this is that film."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,384,"Wonder Woman ends with a sequel on the horizon, that will certainly get made if the movie inspires little girls to ditch their Disney Princess regalia and learn to scare off creeps with the raise of an eyebrow, the Gal Gadot way."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,385,"Gadot turns in a terrific display as the titular protagonist, carrying an infectious sense of optimism and wide-eyed wonderment, while ensuring it never once cheapens her sheer power and ability to fight."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,386,"Gal Gadot has an adventure all her own - and all kinds of awesome - in Wonder Woman, a superheroine film brimming with majesty, action and heart."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,387,"Gadot was mostly one-dimensional and stoic in her 20 minutes of screen time in Batman v Superman, but here she is lively and exudes a sense of wonder."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,388,"The hero faces off against a seemingly insurmountable bad-guy-from-Central-Casting, throwing around what appears to be a range of fluorescent Photoshop-generated squiggly lines."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,389,"What's striking about [Wonder Woman] is the movie's sense of elated lightness."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,390,"A dynamic and original film we're so thrilled for you girls and boys to see."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,391,"If Gal Gadot's all-too-brief appearance in Batman v Superman was promising, she fulfills that potential and then some in Wonder Woman."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,392,"Gal Gadot's Diana is her best performance to date, blending the kindness, power, and innocence needed for the iconic character."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,393,"Wonder Woman is a beautifully directed superhero movie origin that digs into Diana's transformation from naive warrior to inspiring hero."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,394,"Praise be, does Wonder Woman ever kick ass."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,395,"Dawn Of Justice proved [Gadot] could handle the kicking and the punching. Here, she gets actual honest-to-goodness dialogue, and invests Diana with excitable exuberance , bristling defiance and a disarming belief in doing the right thing."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,396,"Strong, smart, sexy and downright super, this is the superhero blockbuster of the summer you need to see."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,397,"As witty and heartfelt as it is thrilling - a film that fangirls, fanboys and even those suffering from superhero fatigue can enjoy."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,398,"Where Wonder Woman excels is in the pure joy and spectacle of its roaring action sequences, which are conservatively deployed to maintain their power."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,399,"It is the sincerity and strength that radiate from Gadot that completely win you over in a solid, however implausible, script. Justice League? Bring it on."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,400,"What Patty Jenkins is able to do with all of that is ground it in emotion and character, to make audiences smile and walk out of the theater feeling uplifted rather than exhausted. It's the movie we've been waiting for. Trust me."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,401,"It's a film that not only improves upon many of the seemingly built-in shortcomings of superhero movies, but also mixes smarts, sentiment and adrenaline in the best Hollywood style."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,402,"In a genre where fanboy entitlement regularly calls the tune, Wonder Woman's feminism feels like a rarity. Time will tell whether Hollywood [will be] in the thrall of a heroine addiction. But as the credits rolled, I was already craving another hit."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,403,"It gives us the kind of hero a lot of us fell in love with back in those 12-cent days of truth, justice and the American way - and the kind of movie we haven't seen since Christopher Reeve first flew into our lives."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,404,Wonder Woman is leaps and bounds above the other three entries in the DCEU.
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,405,"Like the heroine at its center, Wonder Woman the movie rises with powerful grace above the noise. It's not perfect, but it's often good, sometimes great and exceptionally re-watchable."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,406,"The film's action is explosive and engaging, and a sequence where Diana ventures into no man's land in the middle of a trench battle is stunning to behold."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,407,"Wonder Woman is smart, slick, and satisfying in all of the ways superhero films ought to be."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,408,"Gadot is entirely credible as the embodiment of Amazonian perfection, but there's only so much emotion her concerted brow-furrowing can convey."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,409,"[Wonder Woman] isn't just a triumph for women, it's a triumph, period. This is grand entertainment with rousing action, sparkling humor, a romantic streak and a titanium-strength debut from Gal Gadot in the title role."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,410,"Patty Jenkins' Wonder Woman provides a welcome respite from DC's house style of grim darkness with star Gal Gadot proving an inspired choice for this avatar of truth, justice and the Amazonian way."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,411,"Jenkins' feature flips back through time to deliver an origin story that functions beautifully on its own while also bolstering excitement for the franchise's future."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,412,"It's a lot closer to 'Batman Begins' than 'Green Lantern'."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,413,"WONDER WOMAN brings a powerful voice to the summer blockbuster; one filled with hope, inspiration and more than enough thrills to satisfy everyone."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,414,"This origin story, with its direct and relatively uncluttered trajectory, offers a welcome change of pace from a superhero realm that's often overloaded with interconnections and cross-references."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,415,"Along with the first ""Iron Man,"" it's the film you point to when you want to prove that this overly prolific genre is worth keeping around."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,416,"A bright, exciting film that manages to meld the more epic ""gods among us"" DC-style with moments of levity and pathos."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,417,"Seeing the Amazons training with beautiful ferocity, seeing women so powerful and skilled...was a revelation."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,418,"Gal Gadot grabs the Lasso of Truth and the bracelets of infinite resilience to take center stage in Wonder Woman, director Patty Jenkins' formidable and almost entirely successful bid to make the DC Comics movies a little less lame."
WonderWoman,WonderWoman_rm,419,Wonder Woman is coming out at a good time. This is the movie a lot of us need right now and Wonder Woman is the hero we all kind of need right now.
